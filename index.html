<p>First things first, this post is <strong>really long</strong>. If you don't want to read it all right now, I recommend bookmarking it or using Reddit's save feature so you can come back to it later. This was originally going to be a Reddit text post, but it quickly exceeded the forty thousand character limit and now stands at nearly four times that amount, which is why I've moved it to a separate site. This also means I can continue to update the timeline even after the Reddit thread gets automatically locked.</p>
<p>Secondly, this timeline contains <strong>all the spoilers</strong>. Please don't read it unless you're caught up on the show and you've read all the comics you intend to read. I also recommend you read <em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, since a lot of the timeline draws from that.</p>
<p>I am from the UK, so one must pardon any British spelling or grammar.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h3>
<img src="images/thank you.png" alt="Thank You">
<p>This post was inspired by several <em>Adventure Time</em> timelines published before it. The main reason I started this project was because <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/IpzJZ">the timeline by RedLionKing</a> has become outdated and only deals with the core storyline, although my version isn't anywhere near as beautifully written so I recommend you check it out anyway. Also credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/66ku1x/complete_adventure_time_timeline_spoilers/">this concise timeline by Viernes_de_Siluetas</a>, from whom I stole the date system.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/uncivilizedelk">Uncivilized Elk</a> for his in-depth episode analysis videos which have inspired some details of the timeline, and thanks to all the editors and transcribers on the <a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki"><em>Adventure Time</em> Wiki</a> without whom this task would have been a lot more arduous.</p>
<p>Lots of credit to <a href="https://spiderciderko.tumblr.com/">SpiderCider</a> and DÃ©cadent for painstakingly translating this entire piece into Korean for our friends in the east. If anyone is interested in providing translations for any other languages, drop me a PM.</p>
<p>And of course, thanks to Pendleton Ward and the entire <em>Adventure Time</em> crew for creating one of the most deep, complex, and inspiring worlds in the history of children's television.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<img src="images/paper pete 2.png" alt="Paper Pete">
<p>This timeline is designed to be as complete as possible. This means that not only am I drawing events from the show, but also from <strong>all</strong> officially licensed material.</p>
<p>In general, <em>Adventure Time</em> content can be organised into one of three different categories of canonicity:</p>
<p><font color="green">Top tier</font>: Episodes and shorts created by the show's crew, plus some of the guest-animated episodes.<br>
<font color="orange">Middle tier</font>: Licensed material created by members of the show's cast and crew (the <em>Islands</em> prequel, the <em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>, etcetera), as well as the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> (Spring answers, social media posts, etcetera).<br>
<font color="red">Bottom tier</font>: Licensed material created by people not associated with the production of the show. This includes most of the comics, graphic novels, and video games.</p>
<p><a href="media.html">Click here</a> for a list of every single piece of media which has been considered for the timeline.</p>
<p>People generally don't consider the main comic series canon due to the lack of subtlety in its plot and the fact that it is often incompatible with the show. The "official" stance on the canonicity of the comics is blurred. Ryan North, the original writer of the main comic series, has <a href="http://ryannorth.tumblr.com/post/23729809967/something-that-comes-up-pretty-often-is-this">claimed that they are pretty much canon</a>, but Adam Muto, executive producer of the show, <a href="https://ask.fm/MrMuto/answers/134245195208">has suggested otherwise</a>. I'm going to treat the comics like an alternate timeline, which leaves me free to selectively choose which elements I include in the main timeline. I will leave out anything that contradicts the show's continuity, but if an element fits then I see no reason to omit it. At the end of the main timeline I will show some "alternate timelines" such as Farmworld and the various timelines caused by time travel in the comics.</p>
<p>Whenever I make a statement or pull a quote from somewhere, I will show the source in square brackets [like this]. That way, you can make up your own mind whether or not you choose to believe a certain element is canon.</p>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Adventure_Time_episodes#Episodes">official season arrangement</a> for labelling episodes, which is the arrangement composed of ten seasons used by Cartoon Network and Wikipedia but not the one used by the fan wiki and the <em>Adventure Time</em> crew. For example, <em>Elemental</em> is S08E08 rather than S07E34. This doesn't affect the order of individual episodes in any way, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="date-system">Date system</h3>
<img src="images/high strangeness.png" alt="High Strangeness">
<p>All dates are organised around a year zero, which is the year of the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb and the impact of the Blue Catalyst Comet. BMB stands for Before Mushroom Bomb and AMB stands for After Mushroom Bomb. The letter c before a date stands for circa, and indicates that this is an estimated date. The letter X is used to denote any digit (e.g. 99X could be any year from 990 to 999). A corresponding real-life date is displayed in brackets. Since the beginnings and ends of years are not clear, many events may be one year off. Where applicable, the New Year is assumed to be Finn's birthday.</p>
<p>The real-life date of the war can be narrowed down by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Ketchup</em>, Marceline owns a USB flash drive. These were invented in 2000 CE, so this is the earliest possible date of the war.</li>
<li>The penny that Abraham Lincoln holds up in <em>Sons of Mars</em> was minted in the year 20XX CE. The last two digits are obscured by dirt.</li>
<li>VHS tapes and Polaroid cameras are still around at the time of the war. In real life these were obsolete by the early 2010s, so the war probably doesn't take place any later than this.</li>
<li>The chart above (right of PB) is from <em>High Strangeness</em> and appears to show world population over time. A massive dip is seen shortly after the year 2000 CE.</li>
<li>The show first aired in 2010 CE, which makes this a good estimation of the actual date of the war since it was probably intended to take place in the "present day".</li>
</ul>
<p>For labelling things with a real-life date, I have assumed that <strong>0 AMB = 2010 CE</strong>.</p>
<p>The Mushroom Bomb and the Blue Catalyst Comet hit at approximately the same time. Uniting these two pivotal events makes it much easier to put a date to things, so I have assumed that they both take place in 0 AMB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="location-of-ooo">Notes on the location of Ooo</h3>
<p>It can be inferred that the Land of Ooo is an isolated chunk of the western United States, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. The following evidence supports this (credit to <a href="https://reddit.com/u/BabyEatingFox">/u/BabyEatingFox</a> for some of these points):</p>
<p>Signs for Interstate Route 101, the main road passing up the coast of California, are seen in <em>I Remember You</em>:</p>
<img src="images/i remember you.png" alt="I Remember You" style="width:96%;">
<p>Several shots from the episode <em>Simon and Marcy</em> resemble locations in Los Angeles, such as the Vincent Thomas Bridge (left) and the LA River (right):</p>
<img src="images/simon & marcy.png" alt="Simon and Marcy" style="width:96%;">
<p>In <em>Joshua and Margaret Investigations</em>, the investigation bureau appears to be in the ruins of San Francisco. The bridge in the background of the right image closely resembles the Golden Gate Bridge:</p>
<img src="images/joshua and margaret investigations.png" alt="Joshua and Margaret Investigations" style="width:96%;">
<p>In <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>, there is an Arizona license plate on the wall. Arizona borders California:</p>
<img src="images/bonnibel bubblegum.png" alt="Bonnibel Bubblegum">
<p>The show was written in California, so it makes sense that the writers would use their actual location as a base.</p>
<p>There are a few details that contradict this conclusion. For example, the Statue of Liberty is seen buried in the desert in <em>Angel Face</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The Beginning of the Multiverse</strong></p>
<img src="images/gold stars.png" alt="Gold Stars" style="width:96%;">
<blockquote>
  <p>Before there was time - before there was anything - there was nothing. And before there was nothing, there were monsters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- The Lich [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</p>
<p>Reality exists as an infinite chaotic sea of monsters, including beings like Orgalorg, GOLB, and possibly the Lich. By incomprehensible chance, the monsters eventually come to a common agreement on the state of reality, and this consensus becomes the Multiverse. Therefore, despite its appearance to those who inhabit it, the Multiverse is not actually material. The Multiverse is an emergent product of consciousness rather than consciousness being an emergent product of the Multiverse. Every sentient being that lives in the Multiverse paradoxically maintains its existence by experiencing it, and this also means that every sentient being has an existence beyond the material, known as their soul.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Third Orb does not exist, said the Sage.<br>
  Why? asked the Student.<br>
  Because the Multiverse, said the Sage, within which Third Orb exists, does not exist. The Multiverse is a Consensus Reality shared by the Minds of all Sentient Beings. If they were to Die, the Multiverse, as such, would suddenly blink out of existence, vanish, be no more.<br>
  Why? asked the Student.<br>
  Because, said the Sage, there would be no one to Perceive It.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Other than this, the origins of the Multiverse are largely unknown. Nobody knows where the monsters came from or what the true nature of reality is. Everything we know about the world before existence comes from that single glimpse granted by the Lich.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Where did the Multiverse come from? Since logic dictates that asking this question must result in an infinite regression â What created the Multiverse? And what created the Thing that created the Multiverse? And what created the Thing that created the Thing that created the Multiverse? Etcetera â this suggests that the mental engine of logical thinking is not designed to determine the Answer.</p>

<p><strong>The Structure of Existence</strong></p>
<img src="images/the lich.png" alt="The Lich" style="width:96%;">
<p>The Multiverse imagined by the primordial monsters is composed of a vast (perhaps infinite) number of "dimensions" which each hold a universe. One of these is the Earth Dimension, sometimes referred to as Third Orb, which contains the planet Earth as well as all the other planets, stars, and galaxies in our own universe. Other dimensions include the Astral Plane, the Crystal Dimension, Lumpy Space, the Nightosphere, and many more. Amidst this complex system of dimensions is the Time Room:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At the centre of the Multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming wormholes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronisation allowing for the safe passage of particles through a non-local region of space-time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Booko [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
<p>The physics behind the concept of the Multiverse is somewhat explained in chapter four of the Wizards' Enchiridion, albeit in a very hand-wavy pseudo-scientific way. To prevent all of the dimensions from catastrophically colliding with one another, all particles in a specific dimension have their own unique "frequency". Particles with different frequencies reside in different dimensions. Adjusting this frequency allows for interdimensional travel. Another property of each dimension is its "elasticity", which determines how easy it is to change the frequency of particles within that dimension. As stated above by Booko, dimensions can be interlinked if the frequencies of the particles in a local region of both dimensions can be somehow synchronised, hence forming a kind of gateway called a "portal". This is easier in more elastic dimensions. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>A very rudimentary form of temporal synchronisation is demonstrated by Finn when he interacts with the little people, who reside in "a different dimensional plane" according to Jake. Finn shakes the little people, which synchronises their frequencies enough to allow for brief interdimensional communication. [S05E05 <em>All the Little People</em>]</p>
<p>The elasticity of a dimension has other effects besides ease of interdimensional travel. For example, highly elastic dimensions are more easily influenced by magic (more on that in a couple of sections), and are more likely to allow for interspecies hybrids to be born. The most extreme known example of a hybrid so far seen in the show is Jake's granddaughter Bronwyn, who is half bear, a quarter rainicorn, an eighth dog, and an eighth shape-shifter. [S06E12 <em>Ocarina</em>]</p>
<p>The elasticity of a dimension can vary with time. Earth was elastic in the time of the dinosaurs, then became very rigid during modern times, then elastic once again following the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>One final principle of the Multiverse is the concept of "Amok Time", which states that causality can sometimes be reversed. This allows for accurate predictions of the future and the occasional bit of time travel. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<p><strong>The Cosmic Entities</strong></p>
<img src="images/wake up.png" alt="Wake Up" style="width:96%;">
<p>Prismo, who was briefly mentioned earlier, is one of the many "Cosmic Entities" who inhabit the Multiverse. Cosmic Entities are basically immortal gods, and most of them have a specific purpose within the elaborate clockwork of existence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prismo is a Wish Master and the keeper of the Time Room, capable of granting one wish to anyone who succeeds in visiting him. He is kept alive by the dreams of an old man, and later by the dreams of Jake the Dog. [S06E01 <em>Wake Up</em>]</li>
<li>The Cosmic Owl monitors the dreams of every being in the Multiverse and chooses which ones will come true. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl are therefore invariably prophetic, although these dreams are often metaphorical rather than literal. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl in which the dreamer sees their own death are known as "croak dreams". [S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>, S06E36 <em>Hoots</em>]</li>
<li>Death governs the fifty Dead Worlds, where the souls of the inhabitants of the Multiverse go after they die. He lives in a castle of light in the Land of the Dead. [S02E17 <em>Death in Bloom</em>, S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>]</li>
<li>The Catalyst Comet delivers great change to Earth every thousand years. More on that later. [S06E25 <em>Astral Plane</em>]</li>
<li>Many of the monsters from before time exist as Cosmic Entities, including GOLB and Orgalorg. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>, S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It can sometimes be unclear who is and is not a Cosmic Entity. In addition to those above, the fan wiki also lists Grob Gob Glob Grod, Party God, Cuber, Life, the Elementals, Finn, Martin, and the Lich as Cosmic Entities (more on most of these individuals later).

<p><strong>The Concept of Death</strong></p>
<img src="images/sons of mars.png" alt="Sons of Mars" style="width:96%;">
<p><em>Adventure Time</em> has done a surprising amount of exploration around what might happen after you die. There appear to be four main possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could be reincarnated as a new being. This might only apply to Elementals and Agents of Change (more on these later). [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</li>
<li>You could become a ghost, a soul without a material counterpart, and continue to roam the mortal plane. This normally happens when you have "unfinished business". [S06E17 <em>Ghost Fly</em>]</li>
<li>You could become a demon, a physical manifestation of a ghost, and live in the Nightosphere. [<em>Adventure Time Issue 53</em>]</li>
<li>You could be transported to one of the fifty Dead Worlds based on the good and bad things you've done during your life and the way in which you died. It is not clear whether the Dead Worlds are actual dimensions or a separate kind of thing. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, <em>Adventure Time Issue 53</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It is implied that ending up in a higher Dead World is a more desirable outcome. The highest ever mentioned in the show is the Fiftieth, which appears to be the equivalent of Heaven and is probably synonymous with "Glob World". [S03E24 <em>Ghost Princess</em>, S05E21 <em>The Suitor</em>, S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>]</p>

<p><strong>The Concept of Magic</strong></p>
<img src="images/thanks for the crabapples.png" alt="Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!" style="width:96%;">
<p>Since the Multiverse is maintained by the perceptions of the sentient beings within it, the imagination can actually be used to change the very structure of existence. This practice is most commonly known as "magic" and used almost exclusively by witches and wizards, although others can also learn to manipulate the material world using their mind.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>However insecure a wizard might be, wizardry is the realm of the Imagination, and even the flabbiest, most flop-sweaty wizard can warp your perceptions enough to make you believe they are fully capable of kicking your butt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Chapter Two of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Magic most commonly manifests itself in the form of spell-casting, in which magic users recite incantations and channel their imagination through magically charged items in order to produce various effects. They usually have to practice one trick over and over until they are able to consistently perform it, which is why most magic users have a unique but limited arsenal of spells. There are other methods of performing magic as well. For example, Finn has performed magic via meditation and song, and Son of Rap Bear can produce explosions by rapping. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S03E07 <em>Still</em>, S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>, S10E03 <em>Son of Rap Bear</em>]</p>
<p>According to Betty Grof's MMS theory, all magic users have varying levels of magic, madness, and sadness. These three properties are required in order to reliably perform magic. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>]</p>
<p>There are two perspectives on the concept of magic. Scientists like Princess Bubblegum believe that it happens due to observational quantum effects and is grounded in scientific principles. On the other hand, magicians choose not to question the methods by which magic is possible, and, thanks to this blind belief, they are far more proficient at performing it. Neither view is incorrect.

<p>The Enchiridion is an ancient tome and one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the Multiverse. Its exact origin is unknown: in fact, due to its paradoxical nature it might not even have a true origin. Over the course of all of history, it is written and enchanted by thousands of wizards. These spells cause it to gain sentience, change with every reading, and contain knowledge from the past and future. The original tome is over eight million pages long. Various abridged copies are eventually produced, all of which retain its magical properties. The tome is split into two books: one for heroes and one for wizards. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Placing gems into various slots in the Enchiridion can produce powerful magic spells. Most notably, filling the gem slots in the front cover enables the user to open a portal to any dimension in the Multiverse, and might even allow for time travel.

<p>On Planet Earth exists the concept of five fundamental elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, Slime and Lumps: parodying the real-life (but false) classical elements of fire, water, earth, air and aether. These will become important later on. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>, S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
<p>A demon named Hunson Abadeer comes into being around this time:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My single earliest memory occurred eons before the Mushroom War. This memory consists of one image: me eating a ham sandwich, perched atop Rock Candy Mountain, overlooking the Sea of Something, long before Plants, Animals, and Actual Things came into existence in the Land of Ooo, surrounded by an all-encompassing Night of Nothingness. Full disclosure: I believe I was a ghost at the time, although it isn't clear how a ghost can sit on a mountain peak or eat a ham sandwich.</p>

<p>Aside from Earth, a multitude of other planets in and around the Solar System are also inhabitable. Eventually, interplanetary travel becomes widespread enough that many of them are able to communicate with one another, forming the backbone of an interstellar community.

<li>The asteroids inhabited by the leaflans and the tuffbones, which appear to be fairly near to Earth because Bubblegum can see them through a telescope and reach them using a conventional rocket. [<em>Marceline Gone Adrift</em>]</li>
<li>The home planet of Cuber and his sister Tuber, where the graybles would be invented. It appears to be a fairly Earth-like world. [S6E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</li>
<li>The planets which were once terrorised by Orgalorg (pictured above). They are home to a range of unique lifeforms. They are probably part of a different star system, as they are unlike any planets in our own Solar System. [S6E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
<li>The planet of the koala people. From what we have seen, this appears to be a desert world where food and water is scarce but gold is plentiful. The koala people fall under the oppressive regime of a group of humanoid lizard people, leading to the emergence of a group of rebels who have been fighting for their freedom ever since. Many other alien species are present on this planet, which reinforces the theory that there is some kind of interstellar community. [S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</li>
<li>The home planet of the grey aliens. According to Tree Trunks' alien husband, a round trip from Earth to this planet and then back would take at least forty years. It is abandoned by its native inhabitants at some point. [S08E17 <em>High Strangeness</em>]</li>

<li>Lun inhabits the Moon and rules the element of Ice.</li>
<li>Arklothac rules the element of Candy.</li>
<li>Ng'zot Aa rules the element of Slime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zon, Arklothac, and Ng'zot Aa reap the Earth for many years, terrorising the fledgling life that has begun to appear.

She betrays them and has them locked outside the Earth dimension so that they can do no further harm. [<em>Adventure Time Issue 59</em>]</p>
<p>To prevent the evil Elementals from ever returning, Lun sacrifices herself to create the Sword of Lun, a weapon capable of destroying them should they ever return.

<img src="images/evergreen 2.png" alt="Evergreen" style="width:96%;">
<blockquote>
  <p>Ever since life began on this planet, there have always been embodiments of the four elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime. Across eons and millennia the four Elementals lived, and died, and lived again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Patience St Pim [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>The Elementals are powerful wizards who live on Earth and each represent one of the aforementioned elements. They possess the power to generate and shape their own element in a variety of ways. Whenever an Elemental dies, their soul is reincarnated into a new body, meaning that there is almost always a living representative for each element at any one time. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>]</p>
<p>The fifth element, Lumps, behaves as an "anti-element", and also has an associated Elemental to go with it. The Lumps Elemental is capable of undoing the magic of the other four. Furthermore, Lumps apparently permeates through the universe, similar to aether, its classical counterpart. A Lumpy Space person is seen on the planet of the koala people, suggesting that Lumpy Space is accessible from anywhere in the universe. [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lumps are the subspace molecular lattice that binds together the scientific and magical forces of Ooo. More powerful than any one element, it's the force that orders reality into its true shape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Lumpy Space Queen [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
<p>Like all magic users, the power of the Elementals is entirely dependent on the elasticity of the Earth dimension.

<p>- Grob Gob Glob Grod [S06E25 <em>Astral Plane</em>]</p>
<p>Every comet strike brings great change to the world by delivering a being known as an "Agent of Change" or "Comet Avatar". Sometimes, the Agent of Change will succeed in turning the world into a better place. But sometimes, the comet delivers great evil into the world, and an era of destruction and death ensues. Like the Elementals, the Agents of Change are reincarnated after death so that they can continue their mission over the course of more than one lifetime. [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>

<p>During the time of the dinosaurs, the four Elementals are Urgence Evergreen (Ice), Balthus (Fire), Chatsberry (Candy) and Slimy D (Slime). The Lumps Elemental of this time is never mentioned. Evergreen the Ice Elemental has a mutated dinosaur servant named Gunther, who vainly hopes to eventually become his master's magical apprentice.</p>
<p>Evergreen spots the impending Green Catalyst Comet and notices that it is far more powerful that those that have come before it. It carries so much power that it would wipe out most of the life on the planet, so Evergreen seeks a way to stop it. He uses his knowledge of technology and magic to construct a golden crown capable of granting its wearer their greatest wish, but it needs a power source: the ruby eyes of the lava dog Magwood. To help battle Magwood and retrieve the eyes, Evergreen summons the other three Elementals to his castle from their respective realms. They reject his plan, stating that wish magic is too dangerous and reminding him that even if they die, they will be reincarnated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hath not a Comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness? If this Comet hits, we four indeed may perish, but the elements we embody - Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime - will live on. But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignoring their advice, Evergreen has them frozen and sets off to take on Magwood alone. His mission is successful and he retrieves the eyes before rushing them back to his castle and completing the crown. However, just as he is about to use it to vanquish the Comet, he is attacked by Magwood, who begins to knock down sections of the castle in its blind rage. Evergreen becomes trapped under debris and is unable to put on the crown and wish for the Comet's destruction, so he instead orders his dinosaur servant Gunther to do it. But Gunther's greatest desire is not to destroy the Comet.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of stopping the Comet, Gunther's truest, deepest wish came true. His nose lengthened, white hair grew from his head, and a beard descended from his face as the crown changed Gunther into Evergreen. Snow began swirling within the room. Evergreen was horrified. The Comet had arrived. It was all too late.</p>

<p><strong>Orgalorg and the Yellow Catalyst Comet</strong></p>
<img src="images/orgalorg.png" alt="Orgalorg" style="width:96%;">
<p>One of the monsters from before the beginning of existence is Orgalorg, an evil Cosmic Entity:
<blockquote>
  <p>Orgalorg is an ancient Cosmic Entity who ruled the Solar System with his cruel and deadly whims: The Breaker of Worlds. He was seeking ever more power. He desired to intercept a Catalyst Comet and absorb its essence. Thereby did he offend the King of Mars, who decreed that Orgalorg should be cast down. And yes, he was cast down, by the flaming sword of Grob Gob Glob Grod. Orgalorg was banished to an inhospitable planet where he would forget everything. Yea, even forget his identity and from whence he came. And the prophets say that the gravity of the planet did crush and compress Orgalorg into a more powerless and cuddlesome form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Alien Elders [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<p>The powerless and cuddlesome form of Orgalorg is an immortal penguin who will much later become known as Gunter. He becomes a hunter-gatherer alongside early humans. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<p><em>Note: Orgalorg/Gunter's gender is ambiguous. However, all characters in the show assign him male pronouns so I will too.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Yellow Catalyst Comet strikes the Earth and leaves behind its Agent of Change. Given the colour scheme, it's possible that this Agent of Change will eventually be reincarnated as Jake the Dog, although this has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>The penguin form of Orgalorg appears in some hieroglyphic artwork from the time of the Ancient Egyptians, implying that he joined their society. Construction of the Egyptian pyramids is completed in approximately 2560 BCE, and Charlie, one of the children of Jake the Dog, would study tarot reading and divination there thousands of years later. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>, S08E11 <em>Daddy-Daughter Card Wars</em>]</p>
<p>As humans continue to develop and thrive, the elasticity of the Earth dimensions settles into a more rigid pattern, bringing about the end of magic. For now. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>During the height of the Roman Empire, the penguin form of Orgalorg is a gladiator and a chariot racer in Ancient Rome, and is depicted in some pottery from the time. During the middle ages, he joins some kind of hooded organisation: possibly a monastery or a secret society. During the Elizabethan era, he lives in Britain and appears alongside Elizabethan nobles.

<p>The legend of the Dual Swords takes place during the time of the Ancient Romans:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Legend tells of two mighty gladiators, as bonded to each other in friendship as two sides of a coin, who were made to fight a death match by their wicked emperor. When one of the Heroes' swords was unexpectedly stolen by a flying serpent who liked shiny things, the other Hero split his own sword in half, and the two gladiators each fell on one half in defiance of the cruel emperor's order. Throughout the centuries, the Dual Swords have been separated many times by merchants, curio collectors, and thieves, but they always seem to find their way back together.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, Saint Nicholas comes into possession of Evergreen's crown and wears it. Like the dinosaur Gunther, the original Santa's consciousness becomes stored in the circuitry of the crown. He briefly gains the powers of the Ice Elemental, which could be the cause of Santa Claus' later association with snow and ice. It is unknown whether he is able to overcome the crown or if he succumbs to it until it finds its next host.</p>

<p>- Gunther's consciousness [S08E01 <em>Broke His Crown</em>]</p>
<p>Likewise, the consciousness of Sveinn, a (probably Icelandic) Nordic boy, becomes stored in the crown's circuitry after wearing it just once. Given his heritage, it's possible he has some relation to the Scandinavian dockworker who would later sell the crown to Simon Petrikov. [S08E01 <em>Broke His Crown</em> + storyboards, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>

<img src="images/orgalorg 6.png" alt="Orgalorg" style="width:96%;">
<p>Sometime around the dawn of the twentieth century, the penguin form of Orgalorg opens a drinks manufacturing company called "Gunto's" and becomes fairly wealthy thanks to its success. He owns a car (closely resembling a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Gallery">Ford Model T</a>) and probably still lives in Britain. It seems unlikely that an immortal penguin god would be able to adapt and blend in so well with modern society, but somehow Orgalorg manages to do so without raising too many eyebrows. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: Orgalorg has not yet been renamed Gunter at this point, so the similar name of the company must be a coincidence.</em></p>
<p>During the First World War, he becomes a fighter pilot for the British Royal Air Force and flies a biplane resembling a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopwith_Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>, which entered service in 1917 CE (93 BMB). It is unknown whether or not Orgalorg had any involvement in the Second World War, but at some point he becomes a movie director.

<p>After the death of an unknown previous Elemental, the spirit of the Ice Elemental is reborn as Patience St Pim.

<img src="images/sons of mars 3.png" alt="Sons of Mars" style="width:96%;">
<p>Despite his comfortable integration into human society, Orgalorg somehow realises that he is something more than just an immortal penguin. Since it was the gravity of the planet Earth which compressed him into his current weak form, he recognises that he must attempt to escape into space so that he can take his true form. Meanwhile, a man named Davey Johnson works a desk job at a space agency and is a previous life of Finn Mertens. He is offered the chance to go to space but declines, and thanks to this decision he spots Orgalorg trying to steal the rocket and has him apprehended. [<em>Adventure Time Issue 50</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: Davey was alive before the war, meaning that if the Blue Comet struck at the same time as the war then Davey was actually a previous life of the Blue Comet rather than a future reincarnation of it. This suggests that the Catalyst Comet is not the "original" progenitor of the Agents of Change, so the existence of Davey should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.</em></p>

<p><strong>Simon and Betty</strong></p>
<img src="images/i remember you 2.png" alt="I Remember You" style="width:96%;">
<p>Magic has mostly died out by modern times, with the great heroes and wizards of old becoming nothing but myths and legends. However, there still seems to be a vague awareness of the existence of magic and it is suggested that a number of people still believe in it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself - just had a fascination with superstitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p>Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof are both post-graduate antiquarians studying ancient artifacts and their relation to magic at the University of Petrograd in Russia. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Remember how we first met, when we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first, and when you returned it you left a note inside because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>- Echo of the Lich impersonating Betty Grof [<em>Adventure Time Issue 19</em>]</p>
<p>Betty eventually becomes Simon's fiancÃ©e and they co-author a book called <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>. Following that, Simon discovers two major artifacts on his expeditions which challenge his previously sceptical perspective on magic. The first is Evergreen's crown, which he purchases from an old dockworker in Scandinavia. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p>The second artifact is a copy of the Enchiridion:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On my recent expedition to Islamabad, in a secret vault in the Hindu Kush Mountains, I discovered an incredible artifact - an ancient book known as "The Enchiridion". Laboratory analysis of the paper and ink indicates some of the pages in the second half of the book pre-date recorded history and are composed of plant DNA unknown on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his letter to Betty [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>After returning home from these expeditions, he presents his findings at the Museum of History, but the discoveries receive little recognition. A journalist named Bruce Guese writes a demeaning article, pictured above. [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>, <a href="http://archive.is/Iyq3l">Adam Muto's Spring</a>]</p>
<p>Simon returns to Betty and shows her the crown, putting it on his head as a joke. Suddenly, his head is filled with "secrets of the ice and snow" as the crown continues to fulfil Gunther's wish from all those millions of years ago, and his transformation into a mad ice wizard begins. He chases Betty through the streets, shouting for his princess and firing icy blasts from his hands. While Betty is hiding around a corner, a portal suddenly appears beside her and a version of Simon from a thousand years in the future speaks to her through it. Simon tells her that she disappeared after he wore the crown, and, realising why, she jumps through the portal and joins him in the future. Following Betty's mysterious disappearance, the present day Simon begins to lose his sanity as he slowly succumbs to the crown. He records tapes documenting his physical and mental transformation. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The visions. I fought with them. Shouted at them until I realised it wasn't real, it was the crown... Since then, I see the visions always, whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets - the secrets of the ice and snow - that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: In "Holly Jolly Secrets Part II", Simon states that when he took off the crown he saw Betty "staring at him with such contempt". However, in the episode "Betty" it is shown that Betty escaped to the future while Simon was still wearing the crown.

<p>Marceline is a half-demon half-human hybrid, born just five years before the end of the world. Her father is Hunson Abadeer, the demonic ruler of the Nightosphere, and her mother is an unnamed human from Earth. It is not known how this unlikely relationship arose.</p>

<p>It is also not clear exactly how involved Hunson is in his daughter's childhood. In her scrapbook, Marceline says that she doesn't know anything about him until they meet after the Great Mushroom War, but pictures of her as a child can be seen in his castle, suggesting her parents maintain some form of contact. [S04E05 <em>Return to the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>It seems like Hunson leaves them on their own them at some point shortly before the war:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Look kid, I want you to know I didn't abandon you. You have no idea how hard it was to let you go. Times were tough - even you know that. Your world was ending, and my world devolves into lawlessness when I'm not there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Hunson Abadeer, in Marceline's scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: The Encyclopaedia, "Seeing Red", and other secondary sources published before the Stakes miniseries suggest that Marceline grew up with her father and was a vampire from birth. This is completely false.</em></p>
<p>For some reason, Marceline has almost no memory of her life before the war, so her memories of her mother are also faded.

</blockquote>
<p>- Hunson Abadeer, in the Encyclopaedia [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
<p>After a quick escalation, the world erupts into nuclear war. It earns its name from the mushroom clouds produced by the bombs, which reduce most of human civilisation to ashes. By far the biggest is the Mushroom Bomb, which is powered by something else besides its nuclear payload. It rips an immense chunk out of the Earth's surface and massively increases Earth's elasticity, delivering magic back into the world. It's possible that the whole thing is orchestrated by the Lich, since the bomb allows him to rise from his dormancy. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: It hasn't been confirmed whether it was the comet or the bomb which caused the prominent crater seen in images of Earth from space. However, given the comet strikes every thousand years with no lasting damage, it was probably the bomb.</em></p>

<li>Betty Grof has escaped through a portal to 999 AMB, skipping the war. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>]</li>
<li>Many native werewolves and vampires survive. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</li>
<li>The penguin form of Orgalorg survives because he is immortal. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
<li>Several tribes of humans survive. These are presumably those who were far enough away from the blasts and somehow managed to avoid the radiation. [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel, S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</li>
<li>Randall N. Byron survives by uploading his consciousness into a computer program. [<em>Adventure Time Issue 13</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Continuity error: The Encyclopaedia suggests that Simon remained in hibernation for hundreds of years, but it is now known that he emerged immediately after the end of the war.</em></p>
<p>Due to the increased elasticity, the world begins to change very rapidly. Hybrid creatures are able to be born, and a variety of extra-dimensional creatures begin to flood in through spontaneously formed portals. Rainicorns enter the world and begin a tradition of hunting and eating the surviving humans, who become their main source of food. Rainicorns are able to live off the sparse population thanks to the fact that they are capable of absorbing massive amounts of sustenance from a small amount of meat.

Many survivors are turned into mindless vampire minions who serve the higher members of the court. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>On top of all this, many humans become zombified or mutated by a mixture of radiation and magic, creating the oozers. Some zombified businessmen become preserved in an iceberg. [S05E14 <em>Simon and Marcy</em>, S01E08 <em>Business Time</em>]</p>

He gives her a plush from a nearby toy store, which she names Hambo. [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>]</p>
<p>Marceline appears to have been left there by her mother, who leaves a note for anyone who finds her:</p>

<img src="images/simon & marcy 2.png" alt="Simon and Marcy" style="width:96%;">
<p>Simon and Marceline have begun to settle into their post-apocalyptic lifestyle. Simon becomes a father figure to Marceline in a way that her real father had never been. He gives Marceline a rudimentary education despite the fact that his mental state continues to deteriorate. They both practice kung fu using books they find. Simon begins writing a journal called <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>One day, the two get pursued and cornered by oozers. Simon is forced to use the crown for self-defence, using his powerful ice magic to defeat them. However, it further transforms him and his descent into madness accelerates. At the same time, a collective consciousness called the Mother Gum forms in the ruins and begins helping them. Marceline is seven years old at this point and Simon is forty-seven. [S05E14 <em>Simon and Marcy</em>]</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Marceline and Simon move into an abandoned penthouse apartment and see ghosts for the first time. It is possible that a low level Dead World briefly intersected with the material plane, and these ghosts were victims of the Great Mushroom War. It is also possible that this is when Simon begins to develop his "wizard eyes" which enable him to see into a dimension called the Spirit World.

<p><em>Continuity note: All dates from now until Marceline's hibernation are complete guesses based on how old she looks.</em></p>
<p>Ever since he first put it on, the crown has been urging Simon to re-establish Evergreen's realm of ice, so he finally decides to leave Marceline. To keep Marceline safe, he finds a way to reunite her with her father, Hunson Abadeer. He finds a copy of Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications, the book he co-authored with Betty Grof, and uses it to open a portal to the Nightosphere. He is then able to cast a "binding spell" on Hunson:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It was all there in the book, and even though I was losing my mind, I did it, Marceline! I completed the ritual! The portal actually opened! A rip between dimensions appeared. I saw Hunson and he saw me, each of us watching the other through a weird rip in the barrier that separates our two worlds. After I completed the binding spell on your dad the portal closed and everything went dark. God knows what I did. All I know is that I left you on my sled, headed north, where I will establish my kingdom, as in ancient times Gunther!</p>

<p>After travelling on her own for a while, Marceline stalks two survivors who turn out to be thylacine werewolves named Remi and Rosella, who are proficient in the arcane arts. She befriends them and they agree to help her summon her father, Hunson Abadeer, since they believe he can help them vanquish the tribe of vampires that threatens their pack. Remi and Rosella successfully summon him,  and he bursts uninvited into Marceline's makeshift fort. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Marceline! Long time no see. Some goober with glasses summoned me. Let's go suck some souls!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Hunson Abadeer [S10E07 <em>Marcy and Hunson</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: The episode "Marcy and Hunson" is probably suggesting that Simon directly summoned Hunson. However, according to Marcy's scrapbook, Simon simply cast a binding spell on Hunson, and then it was Remi and Rosella who actually summoned him. I'm going with the second scenario simply because there is more story behind it.</em></p>
<p>To Marceline's horror, Hunson takes Remi and Rosella's souls, reducing them to lifeless husks. Despite this, she knows that this is probably her only opportunity to get to know her father:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even though I hate him for sucking the life from my friends, I need to humour him because, let's face it, who knows what he could do? I can't let him know I don't like him. I can't write him off too quickly. Besides, he's the only one with the answers. There is still so much I don't know about myself and where I come from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Marceline Abadeer, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Their relationship becomes somewhat stable after a day at an abandoned carnival, and Marceline believes she is beginning to understand her father's motives. She inherits the Abadeer Axe, the weapon used by Hunson to take over the Nightosphere all those years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When I touched it, a strange feeling coursed through my veins, like a jolt of energy. This axe has some serious juju about it. Good or bad, I didn't really care. It's a gift from my Dad, and I will cherish it forever. Funny how your feelings can change so completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Marceline Abadeer, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: The graphic novel "Seeing Red" suggests that Hunson turned the axe into a bass guitar when he gave it to Marceline. This contradicts the episode "It Came from the Nightosphere" when Hunson says "Did you turn it into some kind of lute?" and is therefore false.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this friendship doesn't last long. Hunson says he wants to help the remaining werewolves with their vampire problem, so they track down the rest of the pack to a truck stop on Route 90. In a repeat of his previous actions, he wipes out the entire werewolf pack and claims that he "helped" them, since the vampires would have killed them anyway. Upset with him, Marceline goes into the truck stop and manages to make fries, but Hunson eats them. This is the last straw. In a rage, Marceline banishes him back to the Nightosphere, abruptly ending his nine day visit. She writes the <em>Fry Song</em> shortly after. [<em>The Enchiridion and Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

She meets a dog that managed to survive on the food in the mall's pet shop, and names it Schwabl.

She realises that she is capable of using her demon soul-sucking ability to absorb his powers, and gains from him the ability to fly. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>Later, while trying to catch food, she accidentally lassos a human girl wearing a bunny hat, who runs away from her. She stalks her and discovers an entire tribe of survivors, who wear animal hats to protect their necks from vampire bites. They are led by a man named Two Bread Tom, and the bunny girl is named Jo. They initially run away from Marceline because of her sharp demon teeth and her ability to fly, but eventually come to trust her. She becomes good friends with Jo.

<p>In the ruins of the city, Marceline meets a second tribe who appear to be an offshoot of the first.

<p>At some point, the third member of the Vampire Court, the Empress, meets Simon and tricks him into doing her bidding. Marceline stakes the Empress and gains from her the power of invisibility. It is unknown whether or not she meets back up with Simon during this ordeal.</p>

The tribe travels to the shoreline and begins refurbishing a large pre-war cargo ship. Marceline goes with them to protect them.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>- Two Bread Tom [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>The tribe is suddenly attacked by the last of the vampires and is forced to set sail as soon as possible. Marceline stakes the Heirophant, absorbing his shape-shifting powers. This leaves the Vampire King as the very last of his kind. However, just as she is forcing her stake through his heart, he bites her neck and transforms her into a vampire herself. The Vampire King is killed and Marceline proclaims the full title of "Marceline the Vampire Queen". The humans set sail without her. [S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>]</p>

<p><em>Note: If the name of the island refers to just a single founder (i.e. Two Bread Tom) then the apostrophe would be placed like so: "Founder's Island".

Jo gets abducted by a giant bird and carried to the other side of the island, and spends weeks making her way back again. Tom decides that, to avoid losing anyone else, the islanders should construct a guardian to kill anything that tries to enter or leave the Islands. When Jo returns, she disagrees with his plans to seal off the island, so she and a group of the other islanders rebel and split from the main group.</p>

The animal hats originally worn by the tribe members to protect against vampire bites remain an important part of their culture and a symbol of their highly protective attitude.

<p><strong>Kewlboy and the Omega Algorithm [COMICS ONLY]</strong></p>
<img src="images/issue 13.png" alt="Issue 13" style="width:96%;">
<p>Prior to the Mushroom War, a human named Randall N. Byron grew up to become an accomplished video game hacker under the alias "Kewlboy".</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My magnum opus was a piece of self-replicating code that sought out games and modified them to give you better dudes to play with. Sometimes the dudes would even get my face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Randall N. Byron [<em>Adventure Time Issue 13</em>]</p>
<p>Despite the claim that his game mods were his greatest achievement, he also manages to do something far more noteworthy: he programs his entire consciousness into a computer program and survives the Mushroom War. Following the war, Randall and his magnum opus proliferate through thousands of decaying machines and eventually meet a pre-war military program called the Omega Algorithm, whose purpose was to destroy whatever system it was installed on.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As usual, my software infected it. But Omega was different: it adapted to what my code was doing. After two full weeks of battle - an eternity in computer terms - the two pieces of software reached a kind of truce: they merged with each other, combining into... something else. Something new. Their mission changed. "Seek out games and give you better dudes" plus "destroy target systems" became "seek out and systematically destroy better dudes".</p>

</blockquote>
<p>- <em>Teen Zine</em> [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
<p>Marceline wakes up from her long hibernation, and is still alive thanks to the fact that vampires don't age. She meets Bonnibel Bubblegum, who by this point is preparing to construct her kingdom. Somehow, the Enchiridion that Marceline was carrying ends up stowed away on Mount Cragdor. It's possible that Marceline shows it to Bubblegum, who recognises its importance and has it protected. [S01E05 <em>The Enchiridion!</em>]</p>
<p>Despite their very opposite personalities, Marceline and Bubblegum become good friends thanks to their mutual longevity and may have dated for a while. Marceline gives Bubblegum a rock-themed shirt, which becomes one of her most treasured possessions. They would frequently explore the candy mines together. [S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S05E29 <em>Sky Witch</em>, S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: This ship is an infamous point of contention because it is not yet canon despite being alluded to many times. I used to have a list of evidence here, but it was quite long and off-topic so I've moved it to <a href="bubbline.html">a new page</a>.</em></p>
<p>At around this time, Bubblegum coincidentally digs up both of the two gemstones which crashed to Earth millions of years ago. She turns them into magic amulets, one of which can shoot lasers and the other of which can bring robots to life. She gives the former to Marceline and keeps the other one for herself. [<em>Adventure Time Issue 25</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: In the comics, Marceline is shown living in the Tree Fort at this time, which doesn't make any sense since this happens before Shoko's death. Also, it is implied that Bubblegum didn't create the candy people or claim the title of princess until after she met Marceline, which is now known to be false as shown in "Bonnibel Bubblegum".</em></p>
<p>Marceline and Bubblegum fall out after Bubblegum becomes too obsessed with politics and building her kingdom and isn't able to make time for her friend anymore.

<p>At one point, she meets the Ice King and frees him from a group of evil lunch ladies. [<em>Adventure Time Issue 50</em>]</p>
<p>She is hired by the Bath Boy Gang to steal Princess Bubblegum's amulet, so she knocks herself out and gets taken into care within the walls of the fledgling Candy Kingdom, where she befriends Princess Bubblegum. She helps her complete her secret project, the Gumball Guardians, powerful robots that are charged with protecting the Candy Kingdom from evil. Bubblegum activates them using the power of her amulet. Despite the initial plan, Shoko becomes conflicted about completing the job after Bubblegum gifts her a new robotic arm. However, she goes through with it anyway and attempts to steal the amulet while Bubblegum is asleep. She is spotted and attacked by the Gumball Guardians, who send her hurtling into the radioactive river which still surrounds the kingdom. Mutated and disfigured, but endowed with a new biological arm, Shoko crawls away and dies under the sapling of a willow tree.</p>

<img src="images/the thin yellow line.png" alt="The Thin Yellow Line" style="width:96%">
<p>While Princess Bubblegum often comes across as a benevolent and carefree leader, the early Candy Kingdom is not as sweet as its name might suggest. She is largely feared by her subjects due to the fact that the story of the first candy people becomes warped and corrupted, framing Gumbald as the victim and Bonnibel as the enemy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>She's an unknowable goddess. When the first candy people rose against her, she transformed them into hideous monsters. Her own brother Neddy: she imprisoned him beneath the great tree. And the rattleball boys? She iced all those guys. She's amazing, and she's flippin' scary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Banana Guard 16 [S07E26 <em>The Thin Yellow Line</em>]</p>
<p>This reputation is not helped by several questionable actions taken by Bubblegum in the early years of her reign. In order to enforce the law within the fledgling candy kingdom, Bubblegum first creates the Banana Guard. However, they are largely ineffective, so she invents a more serious police force, the aforementioned rattleballs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. Our righteous swords cut a swathe through the chaos, but we were too successful. Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational, and sentenced to death. I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Rattleballs [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum takes extreme action by having all of them executed, and reinstates the Banana Guard. Rattleballs is the only unit to escape. He leaves the walls of the kingdom and goes to live in hiding in the dump. [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
<p>In her controlling paranoia, Bubblegum also establishes mass surveillance networks in her kingdom to watch her citizens and track their every move. [S04E20 <em>You Made Me</em>, S06E15 <em>Nemesis</em>, S06E22 <em>The Cooler</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>

<p>MO Co existed before the war and survived thanks to Moe becoming a cyborg. Moe builds two robots: AMO, who is built to receive love, and BMO, who is built to provide it. AMO goes insane from a lack of love and leaves on a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The Fire Giants ignite the Fire Kingdom in the south of Ooo, allowing for the rise of the flame people. By 1000 AMB, the Fire Kingdom is one of the most powerful states in Ooo, perhaps second only to the Candy Kingdom. It is unknown what Moe's motives were for building such machines in the first place.</p>
<p>The history of the Fire Kingdom is one full of conspiracy, treachery, and regicide. One member of the royal family, who would later become known as "Flame King", plots to take the throne by murdering the impeding heirs until it is rightfully his. A flame guard named Leroy assists in overthrowing seven different rulers to allow Flame King to eventually rise to power. One of those rulers is Flame King's brother, who is murdered by Flame King. His sons Furnius and Torcho seek vengeance upon their uncle. [<em>Finn and Jake Investigations: Sour Notes</em>, S04E22 <em>Ignition Point</em>]</p>

<p><strong>The Other Kingdoms</strong></p>

<p>Numerous other kingdoms and states begin to crop up all over Ooo. Most of them are tiny and remain under the effective jurisdiction of the Candy Kingdom, such as the Hot Dog Kingdom. However, a few are large enough to rival it. Most notable among these are the aforementioned Fire Kingdom, the Slime Kingdom, and Wizard City. The princesses and other leaders form various political organisations to keep the peace. Princess Bubblegum, ruler of the Candy Kingdom, does her best to remain the de facto dictator of Ooo through a combination of excellent diplomacy and some other shadier dealings.</p>
<p>The Slime Kingdom eventually falls under the rule of Slime Princess, who is the reincarnation of the Slime Elemental following the death of the previous one in the Great Mushroom War. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>Most kingdoms are ruled by a leader with the title "princess", even though prior to the war this title was used only by female heirs. This is because Bubblegum chose to adopt the title in revenge for Gumbald mockingly calling her "prinzessin". It's likely that the other kingdom founders follow suit. [S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>However, some kingdoms including Lumpy Space and the Fire Kingdom continue to use the title in the traditional sense, with the actual rulers being called kings and queens. [S01E02 <em>Trouble in Lumpy Space</em>, S03E26 <em>Incendium</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum probably distributes the gems from the Enchiridion to some of the other royals for safekeeping. [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>

<p>The Islands are locked off to the rest of the world. Nobody is allowed to enter or leave, and many of the hiders who try to escape are killed by the Guardian. Others are captured by the "seekers", genetically engineered super-humans who prevent people from leaving the Islands' shores and send captured hiders to re-education. The seekers have implants in the side of their heads which can be used to feed information directly into their brains.

While she is still a baby, the Flame King hears a prophecy that her powers will be far greater than his own, and so has her cast out into the wilderness to perish for fear of being usurped. However, his squire takes pity on the child and leaves her in the care of a lumberjack near the Candy Kingdom.

However, Tree Trunks was already living in the Candy Kingdom with Wyatt at the time of Jake's birth as shown in "Joshua and Margaret Investigations". For Tree Trunks to have been captain of La Femme du la Mer at the time of Martin's escape, either she would have had to build and sell off her company in a matter of months, or Finn is significantly older than Jake, neither of which seem plausible.

<blockquote>
  <p>You and your father were never coming back. Dark days grew darker. I went into myself. And while I retreated, Dr Gross' work turned strange and dangerous. Her actions unwittingly led to the release of a terrible virus. We tried to consolidate and quarantine everyone on Founders' Island. The fatality rate in the general population grew to sixty-two percent. But the fatality rate in helpers - those who faced the virus daily - was one hundred percent. Or nearly.</p>
  <p>I was only one helper, and in no condition to do my job. I made my decision. With my brain-map loaded to the web, I could be hundreds of helpers. And humanity needed help above all else. Since that day I have protected and cared for all my people.</p>

<p>The present-day events of the show take place. Finn is twelve years old in 996 AMB and turns seventeen by the end of the series. Since all of these events are chronologically documented in the show, comics, graphic novels and so on, I won't go over them.</p>
<p>An approximate date for placing things can be obtained by assuming that Finn's birthday falls on the New Year. Here is a fairly chronological list of all <em>Adventure Time</em> stories set during the time of the show. Note that most of these works probably aren't canon. The show is the only thing guaranteed to be canon. Stories that take place in the genderswapped universe and stories set in the past are not included here. Secondary sources are dated using their publication date relative to episodes of the show, although a few things have been rearranged when that causes continuity errors. E.g. <em>Finn and Jake Investigations</em> takes place in 999 AMB because Magic Man is present and it contains the origin story of the Food Boys, even though the game was released after season 6.</p>

He remains sane enough that he succeeds in completely stopping the Mushroom Bomb using his ice powers.

Bubblegum, depressed and alone, lives in the frozen war-torn ruins of the Candy Kingdom. Luckily, Finn is able to remember the plans for the time machine from the robot apocalypse timeline. He travels back to the present day and is able to erase the timeline by making Mnemonoid be friends with LSP, an infinite source of gossip which is able to sustain him much more effectively than Finn's memories.
