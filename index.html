<p>First things first, this piece is <strong>really long</strong>. If you don't want to read it all right now, I recommend bookmarking it so you can come back to it later. This was originally going to be a Reddit text post, but it quickly exceeded the forty thousand character limit and now stands at about six times that amount, which is why I've moved it to a separate site. This also means I can continue to update the timeline for as long as new <em>Adventure Time</em> content is being released.</p>
<p>Secondly, this timeline contains <strong>all the spoilers</strong>, up to and including <em>Come Along With Me</em>, the finale. Please don't read it unless you've finished the show and you've read all the comics you intend to read. I also recommend you read <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, since a lot of the timeline draws from that.</p>
<p>I am from the UK, so one must pardon any British spelling or grammar.</p>
<p>Please leave your thoughts and criticisms in the comments section at the bottom of the page, and keep it civil. If you would like to message me privately, send a PM to one of my social media accounts, linked at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="images/thank you.png" alt="Thank You">
<h3 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h3>
<p>This piece was inspired by several <em>Adventure Time</em> timelines published before it. The main reason I started this project was because <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/IpzJZ">the timeline by RedLionKing</a> has become very outdated and only deals with the core storyline of the show's past, although my version isn't quite as beautifully written so I recommend you check it out anyway. Also credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/66ku1x/complete_adventure_time_timeline_spoilers/">this concise timeline by Viernes de Siluetas</a>, from whom I stole the date system.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/uncivilizedelk">Uncivilized Elk</a> for his in-depth episode analysis videos which have inspired some details of the timeline, and thanks to all the editors and transcribers on the <a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki"><em>Adventure Time</em> Wiki</a> without whom this task would have been a lot more arduous.</p>
<p>Lots of credit to <a href="https://spiderciderko.tumblr.com/">SpiderCider</a> and <a href="https://already-19.tumblr.com/">Décadent</a> for translating this entire piece into Korean. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XHZE-Zwh_3TKVZZa-FqoncztgD-iPk05">🇰🇷 Click here!</a> Although it hasn't been updated since <em>The First Investigation</em> came out and doesn't include any of the present day sections so it's quite out of date now. If anyone is interested in providing translations for any other languages, drop me a PM.</p>
<p>And of course, thanks to Pendleton Ward, Adam Muto, and the entire <em>Adventure Time</em> crew for creating one of the most deep, complex, and inspiring worlds in the history of children's television.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<p>This timeline is designed to be as complete as possible. This means that not only am I drawing events from the show, but also from many other pieces of officially licensed material, including comics, video games, and graphic novels.</p>
<p>One question that gets thrown around a lot is "Are the comics canon?" The short answer is no. <a href="https://twitter.com/UncivilizedElk/status/1034295557051695104">Adam Muto</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPendarvis/status/1028301567294889985">Jack Pendarvis</a> have both clearly stated that they are not. However, the comics are officially licensed, and many of them fit very neatly into the lore of the show. In fact, the only comics which are dramatically irreconcilable with the show are the Bag of Holding arc, in which Finn and Jake throw the Lich into the Sun, and the <em>Seeing Red</em> graphic novel, which contains a multitude of inaccuracies regarding Marceline's past. Other than that, there are only minor plot holes to overlook. Therefore, I'm going to treat the comics like an alternate timeline, which leaves me free to selectively choose which elements I include in the main timeline.</p>
<p><a href="media">Click here</a> for a list of every single piece of media which has been considered for the timeline. I have also considered things like promotional art and social media posts from members of the show's crew, although these are often tongue-in-cheek and shouldn't be taken as canon in every instance. Storyboards and other production material might also be sourced, but only for clarification; cut scenes do not count. Scrapped episodes also do not count.</p>
<p>Whenever I make a statement or pull a quote from somewhere, I will show the source in square brackets [like this]. That way, you can make up your own mind whether or not you choose to believe a certain element is canon.</p>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Adventure_Time_episodes#Episodes">official season arrangement</a> for labelling episodes, which is the arrangement composed of ten seasons used by Cartoon Network and Wikipedia but not the one used by the fan wiki and some members of the crew. For example, <em>Elemental</em> is S08E08 rather than S07E34. This doesn't affect the order of individual episodes in any way, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
<hr>

<img class="img-fluid" src="images/high strangeness.png" alt="High Strangeness">
<h3 id="date-system">Date system</h3>
<p>All dates are organised around a year zero, which is the year of the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb and the impact of the Catalyst Comet. BMB stands for Before Mushroom Bomb and AMB stands for After Mushroom Bomb. The letter c before a date stands for circa, and indicates that this is an estimated date. The letter X is used to denote any digit (e.g. 99X could be any year from 990 to 999). A corresponding real-life date is displayed in brackets. Since the beginnings and ends of years are not clear, many events may be one year off. Where applicable, the New Year is assumed to be Finn's birthday.</p>
<p>For labelling things with a real-life date, I have assumed that <strong>0&nbsp;AMB&nbsp;=&nbsp;2010&nbsp;CE</strong>. See the section on the Great Mushroom War for evidence supporting this date.</p>
<p>The Mushroom Bomb and the war-time Catalyst Comet hit at approximately the same time. Uniting these two pivotal events makes it much easier to put a date to things, so I have assumed that they both take place in 0 AMB.</p>

<h3>The Beginning of the Multiverse</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Before there was time&nbsp;- before there was anything&nbsp;- there was nothing. And before there was nothing, there were monsters.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Lich [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Reality exists as an infinite chaotic sea of monsters, including beings like Orgalorg, GOLB, and possibly the Lich. By incomprehensible chance, the monsters eventually come to a common agreement on the state of reality, and this consensus becomes the Multiverse. Therefore, despite its appearance to those who inhabit it, the Multiverse is not actually material. The Multiverse is an emergent product of consciousness rather than consciousness being an emergent product of the Multiverse. Every sentient being that lives in the Multiverse paradoxically maintains its existence by experiencing it, and this also means that every sentient being has an existence beyond the material, known as their soul.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Third Orb does not exist, said the Sage.</p>
  <p class="alt">Why? asked the Student.</p>
  <p>Because the Multiverse, said the Sage, within which Third Orb exists, does not exist. The Multiverse is a Consensus Reality shared by the Minds of all Sentient Beings. If they were to Die, the Multiverse, as such, would suddenly blink out of existence, vanish, be no more.</p>
  <p class="alt">Why? asked the Student.</p>
  <p>Because, said the Sage, there would be no one to Perceive It.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Other than this, the origins of the Multiverse are largely unknown. Nobody knows where the monsters came from or what the true nature of reality is. Everything we know about the world before existence comes from that single glimpse granted by the Lich.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Where did the Multiverse come from? Since logic dictates that asking this question must result in an infinite regression&nbsp;- What created the Multiverse? And what created the Thing that created the Multiverse? Etcetera&nbsp;- this suggests that the mental engine of logical thinking is not designed to determine the Answer.</p>

<h3 id="the-structure-of-existence">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Structure of Existence</h3>
<p>The Multiverse imagined by the primordial monsters is composed of a vast (perhaps infinite) number of "dimensions" which each hold a universe. One of these is the Earth Dimension, which contains the planet Earth (sometimes referred to as "Third Orb") as well as all the other planets, stars, and galaxies in our own universe. Other dimensions include the Astral Plane, the Crystal Dimension, Lumpy Space, the Nightosphere, the Citadel, and many more. Amidst this complex system of dimensions is the Time Room:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>At the centre of the Multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming wormholes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronisation allowing for the safe passage of particles through a non-local region of space-time.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Booko [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The physics behind the concept of the Multiverse is somewhat explained in chapter four of the Wizards' Enchiridion, albeit in a very hand-wavy pseudo-scientific way. To prevent all of the dimensions from catastrophically colliding with one another, all particles in a specific dimension have their own unique "frequency". Particles with different frequencies reside in different dimensions. Adjusting this frequency allows for interdimensional travel. Another property of each dimension is its "elasticity", which determines how easy it is to change the frequency of particles within that dimension. As stated above by Booko, dimensions can be interlinked if the frequencies of the particles in a local region of both dimensions can be somehow synchronised, hence forming a kind of gateway called a "portal". The more elastic a dimension is, the easier it is to open a portal. A very rudimentary form of temporal synchronisation is demonstrated by Finn when he interacts with the little people, who reside in "a different dimensional plane" according to Jake. Finn shakes the little people, which synchronises their frequencies enough to allow for brief interdimensional communication. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S05E05 <em>All the Little People</em>]</p>
<p>The elasticity of a dimension has other effects besides ease of interdimensional travel. For example, highly elastic dimensions are more easily influenced by magic (more on that in a couple of sections), and are more likely to allow for interspecies hybrids to be born. The most extreme known examples of hybrids seen in the show are Jake's descendants, who contain genes from at least four species; bears, rainicorns, dogs, and shape-shifters. The elasticity of a dimension can vary with time. Earth was elastic in the time of the dinosaurs, then became very rigid during modern times, then elastic once again following the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb. [S06E12 <em>Ocarina</em>, S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>One final principle of the Multiverse is the concept of "Amok Time", which states that causality can sometimes be reversed. This allows for accurate predictions of the future and the occasional bit of time travel. At the very beginning of time there is a place called the Vanishing Point, and anyone who gets trapped there will be erased from history. Jake the Dog claims to have seen the Big Bang while travelling back in time to visit the Vanishing Point. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, <em>Beginning of the End #3</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: A slightly more scientifically rooted explanation for the structure of the Multiverse is alluded to in storyboard panels from <em>Crossover</em>. The panels cite a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~alinde/1032226.pdf">1994 <em>Scientific American</em> article</a> by physicist Andrei Linde which talks about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation">eternal inflation model</a>. However, this model has never been explicitly referenced in the show and is pretty much irreconcilable with the other model.</p>
<p class="note">It's also worth mentioning that time travel is handled quite differently in the comics compared to the show. In the comics it is a frequently used plot device, with instances of time travel happening in several arcs including the Time Machine arc, <em>Banana Guard Academy</em>, the Cosmic Elementals arc, <em>Beginning of the End</em>, and the first arc of <em>Season 11</em>. On the other hand, the only real instances of time travel which occur in the show are Betty travelling into the future and the time slips in <em>The First Investigation</em>. Princess Bubblegum even makes it clear that she is not able to produce a "real" time machine in <em>Bad Timing</em>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cosmic-entities">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Cosmic Entities</h3>
<p>Prismo, who was briefly mentioned earlier, is one of the many god-like "Cosmic Entities" who inhabit the Multiverse and make up the pantheon of <em>Adventure Time</em>. Most of them have a specific purpose within the elaborate clockwork of existence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prismo is a Wish Master and the keeper of the Time Room, capable of granting one wish to anyone who succeeds in visiting him. He is kept alive by the dreams of an old man, and later by the dreams of Jake the Dog. [S06E01 <em>Wake Up</em>]</li>
  <li>The Cosmic Owl monitors the dreams of every being in the Multiverse and chooses which ones will come true. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl are therefore invariably prophetic, although these dreams are often metaphorical rather than literal. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl in which the dreamer sees their own death are known as "croak dreams". [S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>, S06E36 <em>Hoots</em>]</li>
  <li>Death governs the fifty Dead Worlds, where the souls of the inhabitants of the Multiverse go after they die. He lives in a castle of light in the Land of the Dead. [S02E17 <em>Death in Bloom</em>, S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>]</li>
  <li>The Catalyst Comet delivers great change to Earth every thousand years. More on that later. [S06E25 <em>Astral Plane</em>]</li>
  <li>GOLB is the embodiment of chaos and discord. When he consumes people, they are reset to their primal state and eventually removed from existence in such a way that not even wish magic can bring them back. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>, S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</li>
  <li>Many of the other monsters from before time likely exist as Cosmic Entities, including Orgalorg. [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It can sometimes be unclear who is and is not a Cosmic Entity. In addition to those above, the fan wiki lists Grob Gob Glob Grod, Party God, Cuber, Life, the Elementals, Finn, Martin, and the Lich as Cosmic Entities. A deity named Malus, who bears a striking resemblance to the real life pagan deity Abraxas, is also seen in one of Simon's books on GOLB. [<a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Deities_and_Cosmic_Entities">Wiki: Category:Deities and Cosmic Entities</a>, S10E15 <em>Come Along With Me Part 3</em>]</p>
<p>Prismo apparently has a "boss" whose identity is unknown. [S07E23 <em>Crossover</em>]</p>

<h3 id="the-concept-of-death">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Concept of Death</h3>
<p><em>Adventure Time</em> has done a surprising amount of exploration around what might happen after you die. There appear to be four main possibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You could be reincarnated as a new being. This might only apply to Elementals and Agents of Change (more on these later). [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</li>
  <li>You could become a ghost, a soul without a material counterpart, and continue to roam the mortal plane. This normally happens when you have "unfinished business". [S06E17 <em>Ghost Fly</em>]</li>
  <li>You could become a demon, a physical manifestation of a ghost, and live in the Nightosphere. [<em>Adventure Time #53</em>]</li>
  <li>You could be transported to one of the fifty Dead Worlds based on the good and bad things you've done during your life and the way in which you died. It is not clear whether the Dead Worlds are actual dimensions or a separate kind of thing. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, <em>Adventure Time #53</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It is implied that ending up in a higher Dead World is a more desirable outcome. The highest ever mentioned in the show is the Fiftieth, which appears to be the equivalent of Heaven and is probably synonymous with "Glob World". [S03E24 <em>Ghost Princess</em>, S05E21 <em>The Suitor</em>, S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>]</p>
<p>According to Jake, lower Dead Worlds are the worlds containing ghosts, which overlap with the material world. [S06E17 <em>Ghost Fly</em>]</p>

<h3 id="the-concept-of-magic">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Concept of Magic</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>What is the Origin of Wizardry? Pour yourself a cold glass of lemonade, sit in a comfy chair, kick your shoes off, lean back, close your eyes, and think. If reality is Mental in nature, analogous to a Cosmic Mind, and if Wizardry is a function of the Imagination, then the Forces of Nature in the Multiverse are akin to the Currents of the Cosmic Imagination. Thus, the Origin of Wizardry is at the Core of Creation, and Wizards can create or destroy as they wish, tapping into the Power of the Cosmic Imagination.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Since the Multiverse is maintained by the perceptions of the sentient beings within it, the imagination can actually be used to change the very structure of existence. This practice is most commonly known as "magic" and used almost exclusively by witches and wizards, although others can also learn to manipulate the material world using their mind.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>However insecure a wizard might be, wizardry is the realm of the Imagination, and even the flabbiest, most flop-sweaty wizard can warp your perceptions enough to make you believe they are fully capable of kicking your butt.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter Two of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Magic most commonly manifests itself in the form of spell-casting, in which magic users recite incantations and channel their imagination through magically charged items in order to produce various effects. They usually have to practice one trick over and over until they are able to consistently perform it, which is why most magic users have a unique but limited arsenal of spells. There are other methods of performing magic as well. For example, Finn has performed magic via meditation and song, and Son of Rap Bear can produce explosions by rapping. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S03E07 <em>Still</em>, S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>, S10E03 <em>Son of Rap Bear</em>]</p>
<p>According to Betty Grof's MMS theory, all magic users have varying levels of magic, madness, and sadness. These three properties are required in order to reliably perform magic. Therefore, individuals with tragic pasts are more likely to be drawn into the world of wizardry, and other individuals may be driven to madness and sadness if they attempt to pursue magic. The three traits enforce and balance each other. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>]</p>
<p>There are two perspectives on the concept of magic. Scientists like Princess Bubblegum believe that it happens due to observational quantum effects and is grounded in scientific principles. On the other hand, magicians choose not to question the methods by which magic is possible, and, thanks to this blind belief, they are far more proficient at performing it. Neither view is incorrect.

<h3 id="the-infinite-enchiridion">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Infinite Enchiridion</h3>
<p>The Enchiridion is an ancient tome and one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the Multiverse. Its exact origin is unknown, but the author is implied to be the reader. Over the course of all of history, it is written and enchanted by thousands of wizards. These spells cause it to gain sentience, change with every reading, automatically translate into the reader's native language, and contain knowledge from the past and future. The original tome is over eight million pages long. Various abridged copies are eventually produced, all of which retain its magical properties. The tome is split into two books: one for heroes and one for wizards. It teaches heroes how to conduct themselves and best serve their wizard masters, and it teaches wizards how to perform many ancient and secret forms of magic. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Every ten thousand years, the Enchiridion transports its original author to the Time Room, where they must make a choice. They can either force the Multiverse to reset to how it was ten thousand years ago, or they can allow it to continue into the unknown. The author almost always chooses to have it reset.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Since we've done this thousands of times, you may feel this Universe has been played out, so to speak. Every other time, you've decided to go back in time and start over, to that moment in the quarry when you were carving your name and your true love's name into the side of the boulder, when you first conceived of writing The Enchiridion. You were the young Wizard who wrote it, but you've forgotten. When I become sentient enough to tell you, after ten thousand years, I remind you and ask you if you'd like to end it all and let the Unknown occur, or if you'd like to go back again and experience another variation of the last ten thousand years. The Multiverse is unstoppable. Even if it ends, it will sprout back into existence again, but this time in some new, unknown way. Just as it did when all of This began. I'm just asking. It's your decision.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>It is somewhat unclear how this cycle fits into the rest of the history of the Multiverse.</p>
<p>Placing gems into various slots in the Enchiridion can produce powerful magic spells. Most notably, filling the gem slots in the front cover enables the user to open a portal to any dimension in the Multiverse, and might even allow for time travel.

<h3>The Formation of the Solar System</h3>
<p>The planets Earth and Mars form in the Earth Dimension around a sentient star called the Sun. [S06E10 <em>Something Big</em>]</p>
<p>On Planet Earth exists the concept of five fundamental elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, Slime, and Lumps: parodying the real-life (but false) classical elements of fire, water, earth, air, and aether. These will become important later on. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>, S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
<p>A demon named Hunson Abadeer comes into being around this time:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>My single earliest memory occurred eons before the Mushroom War. This memory consists of one image: me eating a ham sandwich, perched atop Rock Candy Mountain, overlooking the Sea of Something, long before Plants, Animals, and Actual Things came into existence in the Land of Ooo, surrounded by an all-encompassing Night of Nothingness. Full disclosure: I believe I was a ghost at the time, although it isn't clear how a ghost can sit on a mountain peak or eat a ham sandwich.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Hunson Abadeer, in the Encyclopaedia [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
</div>
<p class="note">Note: This excerpt suggests that the Land of Ooo has existed since the beginning of life on Earth, but this is now known to be false since it did not form until after the Great Mushroom War.</p>
<p>It is not known if Hunson Abadeer was once a living being, or if his soul simply came into existence out of nothing. Even he admits to not knowing his own origin. Once he manifests a physical demon body, he and most other demons end up living in a hellish dimension called the Nightosphere. He claims that he was a carny boss in his youth, going by the name Johnny Corndog. [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>Season 11 #2</em>]</p>

<p>Aside from Earth, a multitude of other planets in and around the Solar System are also inhabitable.

  <li>Mars, the outer neighbour of Planet Earth, which is eventually colonised. Its story is very important to the plot and will be fully explored in a while. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>]</li>
  <li>The asteroids inhabited by the leaflan and the tuffbones, which appear to be fairly near to Earth because Bubblegum can see them through a telescope and reach them using a conventional rocket. [<em>Marceline Gone Adrift #2</em>]</li>
  <li>The home planet of Cuber and his sister Tuber, where the graybles would be invented. It appears to be a fairly Earth-like world. [S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</li>
  <li>The planets which were once terrorised by Orgalorg (pictured above). They are home to a range of unique lifeforms. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
  <li>The planet of the koala people. From what we have seen, this appears to be a desert world where food and water is scarce but gold is plentiful. The koala people fall under the oppressive regime of a group of humanoid lizard people, leading to the emergence of a group of rebels who have been fighting for their freedom ever since. Many other alien species are present on this planet, which reinforces the theory that there is some kind of interstellar community. [S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</li>
  <li>The home planet of the grey aliens. According to Tree Trunks' alien husband, a round trip from Earth to this planet and then back would take at least forty years. It is abandoned by its native inhabitants at some point. [S08E17 <em>High Strangeness</em>]</li>
  <li>Nerraw, the home planet of Warren Ampersand, a small world orbited by an even smaller black hole. Its entire society and culture is fabricated by Warren. [S10E10 <em>Jake the Starchild</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Note: The fan wiki spells the name of this world "Ni'Rah". However, the spelling given by television subtitles is "Nerraw", which makes more sense given this is Warren's name backwards. Nerraw is known to be within the Earth Dimension because in <em>Temple of Mars</em>, King Man makes fun of Jermaine for saying that it's somewhere in space, pointing out that "literally every single thing in this dimension is in space".</p>
<p>The technological level of most interplanetary civilisations is unknown. Some creatures, such as the giant moth, appear to be capable of faster-than-light travel, given the fact that Martin travels from the planet of the koala people back to Planet Earth in a very short time.

<h3>The Elementals</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Ever since life began on this planet, there have always been embodiments of the four elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime. Across eons and millennia the four Elementals lived, and died, and lived again.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Patience St Pim [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The Elementals are powerful wizards who live on Earth and each represent one of the aforementioned elements. They possess the power to generate and shape their own element in a variety of ways. Whenever an Elemental dies, their soul is reincarnated into a new body, meaning that there is almost always a living representative for each element at any one time. The Elementals can occasionally make contact with their past lives. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E19 <em>Jelly Beans Have Power</em>]</p>
<p>The fifth element, Lumps, behaves as an "anti-element", and also has an associated Elemental to go with it. The Lumps Elemental is capable of undoing the magic of the other four, as well as some other types of transfiguration magic. Furthermore, Lumps apparently permeates through the universe, similar to aether, its classical counterpart. A Lumpy Space person is seen on the planet of the koala people, suggesting that Lumpy Space is accessible from anywhere in the universe. [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Lumps are the subspace molecular lattice that binds together the scientific and magical forces of Ooo. More powerful than any one element, it's the force that orders reality into its true shape.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Lumpy Space Queen [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Like all magic users, the power of the Elementals is entirely dependent on the elasticity of the Earth Dimension. For example, Evergreen, who lived millions of years in the past, is capable of constructing an entire castle from ice, whereas the Fire Elemental of the pre-war era struggles to heat a single cup of coffee. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>The symbol used to represent the main four elements is a circle divided into quarters ⊕. This is also the real-life astronomical symbol of Planet Earth. [S08E19 <em>Jelly Beans Have Power</em>]</p>
<p>At one point, four Cosmic Entities each rule over one of the four elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zon inhabits the Sun and rules the element of Fire.</li>
  <li>Lun inhabits the Moon and rules the element of Ice.</li>
  <li>Arklothac rules the element of Candy.</li>
  <li>Ng'zot Aa rules the element of Slime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zon, Arklothac, and Ng'zot Aa reap the Earth for many years, terrorising the fledgling life that has begun to appear. Lun takes pity on the inhabitants of Earth and decides to take action against the other Elementals. She betrays them and has them locked outside the Earth Dimension so that they can do no further harm. To prevent the evil Elementals from ever returning, Lun sacrifices herself to create the Sword of Lun, a weapon capable of destroying them. Before being used, the sword must await its true bearer, "a warrior who can withstand great bodily loss without injury". [<em>Adventure Time #59</em> and <em>#61</em>]</p>
<p>As a result of this event, the Ice Elemental's betrayal would go on to echo and repeat itself several times through history. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>

<h3>The Catalyst Comet</h3>
<p>At around the same time, a Cosmic Entity known as the Catalyst Comet begins its millennial cycle:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Every one thousand years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an Agent of Change.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Grob Gob Glob Grod [S06E25 <em>Astral Plane</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Every comet strike brings great change to the world by delivering a being known as an "Agent of Change" or "Comet Avatar". Sometimes, the Agent of Change will succeed in turning the world into a better place. But sometimes, the comet delivers great evil into the world, and an era of destruction and death ensues. Like the Elementals, the Agents of Change are reincarnated after death so that they can continue their mission over the course of more than one lifetime. [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
<p>The Comet takes on a different colour every time it strikes. So far, four have been depicted: Green, Yellow, Blue, and Purple. The stories behind each of them, and the stories behind the Agents which they spawn, form a core part of the lore of the show and will be explained later in the timeline.</p>

<h3>Evergreen's Crown and the Green Catalyst Comet</h3>
<p>During the time of the dinosaurs, the four Elementals are Urgence Evergreen (Ice), Balthus (Fire), Chatsberry (Candy) and Slimy D (Slime). The Lumps Elemental of this time is never mentioned. Evergreen the Ice Elemental has a mutated dinosaur servant named Gunther, who vainly hopes to eventually become his master's magical apprentice. Gunther briefly meets Finn and Jake while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point. This is the first of several cameos they make throughout history during this journey. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, <em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>
<p>Evergreen spots the impending Green Catalyst Comet and notices that it is far more powerful than those that have come before it. It carries so much power that it would wipe out most of the life on the planet, so Evergreen seeks a way to stop it. He uses his knowledge of technology and magic to construct a golden crown capable of granting its wearer their greatest wish, but it needs a power source: the ruby eyes of the lava dog Magwood. To help battle Magwood and retrieve the eyes, Evergreen summons the other three Elementals to his castle from their respective realms. They reject his plan, stating that wish magic is too dangerous and reminding him that even if they die, they will be reincarnated:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Hath not a Comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness? If this Comet hits, we four indeed may perish, but the elements we embody&nbsp;- Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime&nbsp;- will live on. But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Balthus [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Ignoring their advice, Evergreen has them frozen and sets off to take on Magwood alone. His mission is successful and he retrieves the eyes before rushing them back to his castle and completing the crown. However, just as he is about to use it to vanquish the Comet, he is attacked by Magwood, who begins to knock down sections of the castle in its blind rage. Evergreen becomes trapped under debris and is unable to put on the crown and wish for the Comet's destruction, so he instead orders his dinosaur servant Gunther to do it. But Gunther's greatest desire is not to destroy the Comet.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Instead of stopping the Comet, Gunther's truest, deepest wish came true. His nose lengthened, white hair grew from his head, and a beard descended from his face as the crown changed Gunther into Evergreen. Snow began swirling within the room. Evergreen was horrified. The Comet had arrived. It was all too late.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter Five of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The comet kills the four Elementals, and is likely to be the event which causes the extinction of the dinosaurs. The crown saves Gunther by storing his consciousness in its circuitry. In the future, any individual who wears the crown will turn into Gunther's image of Evergreen: a mad and powerful ice elemental. [S08E01 <em>Broke His Crown</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p>It is likely that the Green Comet's Agent of Change is the Lich, an embodiment of evil whose only desire is to extinguish all life. He is "the last scholar of GOLB", although the exact meaning of this is unknown. Since the Multiverse is maintained by the conscious beings within it, the end of life would mean the end of the Multiverse, and reality would return to its initial state of chaos and monsters. This is probably the Lich's ultimate goal. The Lich lies dormant for millennia, awaiting the right opportunity to rise to power. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>, S09E13 <em>Whispers</em>]</p>

<p>Vampires are terrifying humanoid creatures who suck the blood from the necks of other creatures for nourishment and are capable of turning their victims. However, vampires in <em>Adventure Time</em> do not actually feed on blood itself, instead taking their sustenance from the colour red. This doesn't stop most vampires from feeding on blood anyway.

<h3>The First Coming of GOLB</h3>
<p>Earth is not the only place in the Solar System harbouring life. At some point, a utopian society emerges on Mars. It is not clear where they came from, but it has been theorised that they are advanced humans who became somehow transported back in time. This theory is supported by the following facts: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Their king is Abraham Lincoln, a human from the future. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>]</li>
  <li>Moe was involved in the design of the Martian colony, as seen in blueprints while his memory is playing. [S07E15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know Part 2</em>]</li>
  <li>Betty Grof says that Glob's helmet would react to her "ancient human DNA code", suggesting a connection between humans and Martians. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Lincoln's champion is the four-faced Grob Gob Glob Grod, who later becomes entwined in the religious beliefs of the inhabitants of Earth. Glob has a brother named Magic Man, and Magic Man has a wife named Margles.</p>
<p>Mars is attacked by the ancient Cosmic Entity known as GOLB, the embodiment of chaos, who consumes Margles and completely removes her from existence. To prevent his second coming, Magic Man builds a defence system called the Magical Automated Resistance Generating Laser Energy Supplier (M.A.R.G.L.E.S.) in the image of his late wife, and plans to install it on the peak of Olympus Mons.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I looked everywhere, you know. Every dimension, every Dead World. I even wished you back in Prismo's Time Room, but you were gone&nbsp;- erased. For hundreds of years I held that sadness until my magic and science were strong enough to create you from my nightmares.</p>

<p>After the death of an unknown previous Elemental, the spirit of the Ice Elemental is reborn as Patience St Pim. She and the other Elementals of the modern generation discover their powers and eventually find one another, although their powers are weak due to the rigidity of the Earth Dimension at this time.

<p>By this time, Patience is already making plans for an "elemental purification spell" which she plans to use to re-establish the four elemental realms. She briefly meets Finn and Jake on the streets of a city while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point, and rants to them about her plan.</p>

<h3>The Human Space Age</h3>
<p>Despite his comfortable integration into human society, Orgalorg somehow realises that he is something more than just an immortal penguin. Since it was the gravity of the planet Earth which compressed him into his current weak form, he recognises that he must attempt to escape into space so that he can take his true form. Meanwhile, a man named Davey Johnson works a desk job at a space agency and is a previous life of Finn Mertens. He is offered the chance to go to space but declines, and thanks to this decision he spots Orgalorg trying to steal the rocket and has him apprehended. [<em>Adventure Time #50</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: Davey was alive before the war, meaning that if the Blue Comet struck at the same time as the war then Davey was actually a previous life of the Blue Comet rather than a future reincarnation of it. This suggests that the Catalyst Comet is not the "original" progenitor of the Agents of Change, so the existence of Davey should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. See "The Blue Catalyst Comet" for more discussion about the placement of that comet.</p>

<h3>Simon and Betty</h3>
<p>Magic has mostly died out by modern times, with the great heroes and wizards of old becoming nothing but myths and legends. However, there still seems to be a vague awareness of the existence of magic and it is suggested that a number of people still believe in it:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself&nbsp;- just had a fascination with superstitions.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof are both post-graduate antiquarians studying ancient artifacts and their relation to magic at the University of Petrograd in Russia. They meet each other in June in about the year 1990 CE, just before Betty was due to leave on a six month trip to study petroglyphs in the Australian outback. She cancels the trip and becomes almost obsessed with Simon. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, <em>Adventure Time/Regular Show #4</em>, S10E11 <em>Temple of Mars</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I never took that trip. I met Simon the next day and he was just so... amazing. I put everything on hold to help him search for the Enchiridion.</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>Remember how we first met, when we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first, and when you returned it you left a note inside because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.</p>

</div>
<p>Betty eventually becomes Simon's fiancée and they co-author a book called <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>. Simon's research into the arcane leads him to discover the existence of GOLB, but he is  hospitalised after Betty tries to throw him a jar of cherries and he doesn't get any further research done on the subject. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S10E15 <em>Come Along With Me Part 3</em>]</p>

</div>
<p>Following that, Simon discovers two major artifacts on his expeditions which challenge his previously sceptical perspective on magic. The first is Evergreen's crown, which he purchases from an old dockworker in Northern Scandinavia. The second artifact is a copy of the Enchiridion, which he discovers with help from Betty. [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>On my recent expedition to Islamabad, in a secret vault in the Hindu Kush Mountains, I discovered an incredible artifact&nbsp;- an ancient book known as "The Enchiridion". Laboratory analysis of the paper and ink indicates some of the pages in the second half of the book pre-date recorded history and are composed of plant DNA unknown on Earth.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his letter to Betty [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>After returning home from these expeditions, he presents his findings at the Museum of History, but the discoveries receive little recognition. A journalist named Bruce Guese writes a demeaning article, pictured above. [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>, <a href="http://archive.is/Iyq3l">Transcript of above image</a>]</p>
<p>Simon returns to Betty and shows her the crown, putting it on his head as a joke. Suddenly, his head is filled with "secrets of the ice and snow" as the crown continues to fulfil Gunther's wish from all those millions of years ago, and his transformation into a mad ice wizard begins. He chases Betty through the streets, shouting for his princess and firing icy blasts from his hands. While Betty is hiding around a corner, a portal suddenly appears beside her and a version of Simon from a thousand years in the future speaks to her through it. Simon tells her that she disappeared after he wore the crown, and, realising why, she jumps through the portal and joins him in the future. Following Betty's mysterious disappearance, the present day Simon begins to lose his sanity as he slowly succumbs to the crown. He records tapes documenting his physical and mental transformation. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>The visions. I fought with them. Shouted at them until I realised it wasn't real, it was the crown... Since then, I see the visions always, whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets&nbsp;- the secrets of the ice and snow&nbsp;- that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end. I'm really scared.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
</div>
<p class="note">Note: In <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>, Simon states that when he took off the crown he saw Betty "staring at him with such contempt". However, in the episode <em>Betty</em> it is shown that Betty escaped to the future while Simon was still wearing the crown. It's possible he wore the crown once and then for some reason put it on a second time before Betty left.</p>

<h3>The Birth of Marceline Abadeer</h3>
<p>Marceline is a half-demon half-human hybrid, born just five years before the end of the world. Her father is Hunson Abadeer, the demonic ruler of the Nightosphere, and her mother is an unnamed human from Earth. It is not known how this unlikely relationship arose.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Then he said "fine". And that's the story of how I met your dad.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline's mother [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>It is also not clear exactly how involved Hunson is in his daughter's childhood. In her scrapbook, Marceline says that she doesn't know anything about him until they meet after the Great Mushroom War, but pictures of her as a child can be seen in his castle, suggesting her parents maintain some form of contact. [S04E05 <em>Return to the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>It seems like Hunson leaves them on their own them at some point shortly before the war:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Look kid, I want you to know I didn't abandon you. You have no idea how hard it was to let you go. Times were tough&nbsp;- even you know that. Your world was ending, and my world devolves into lawlessness when I'm not there.</p>

</div>
<p class="note">Note: <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>Seeing Red</em>, and other secondary sources published before the <em>Stakes</em> miniseries suggest that Marceline grew up with her father and was a vampire from birth. This is completely false.</p>
<p>For some reason, Marceline has almost no memory of her life before the war, so her memories of her mother are also faded. When she is very young, they go on trips to the beach, and they live in a mobile home for a while, but that is all we know about her. [S09E11 <em>Ketchup</em>, S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>

<h3>Prelude to the War</h3>
<p>The current Elementals meet up every once in a while for coffee. Their magic powers are limited due to the Earth Dimension's rigidity, but they begin to see visions of the impending war. Like Evergreen millions of years before her, Patience St Pim seeks a way to survive this cataclysm, but the other Elementals disagree.

<h3>The Great Mushroom War and the Blue Catalyst Comet</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>The world was filled with explosions that were setting the land aflame from horizon to horizon. The human cretins had succeeded in their program to extinguish themselves from existence, and their insane Mushroom War had begun.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Hunson Abadeer, in the Encyclopaedia [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>After a quick escalation, the world erupts into nuclear war. The Great Mushroom War earns its name from the mushroom clouds produced by the bombs, which reduce most of human civilisation to ashes. By far the biggest is the "Mushroom Bomb", which is powered by something else besides its nuclear payload. It massively increases Earth's elasticity, delivering magic back into the world, and is likely what leaves the distinctive crater in the Earth's surface. It's possible that the whole thing is orchestrated by the Lich, since the bomb allows him to rise from his dormancy. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: It hasn't been confirmed how the crater was formed. The most obvious answer seems to be the Mushroom Bomb, but when it is seen detonating in <em>Finn the Human</em> and <em>Elemental</em>, it is nowhere near as destructive. Alternative theories are that it was formed by one of the Catalyst Comets, or by a combination of many of humanity's other nuclear weapons. A before and after of Planet Earth seen during the <em>Founders' Song</em> in <em>Hide and Seek</em> confirms that it did indeed form during the war.</p>
<p>Despite the near extinction of the human race, there are several survivors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simon Petrikov buries himself under a thick blanket of snow and the crown protects him from the radiation after he emerges. [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</li>
  <li>Marceline Abadeer survives thanks to her half-demon physiology, but her mother doesn't make it. She is seen hiding in a cave while bombs go off outside, and is also seen watching a city burn to the ground. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, <em>Adventure Time #4</em>, S10E13 <em>Come Along With Me Part 1</em>]</li>
  <li>Moseph "Moe" Mastro Giovanni, the owner of the robotics company MO Co, survives by becoming a cyborg. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>]</li>
  <li>Patience St Pim survives because she is frozen deep underwater, although the other Elementals perish. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</li>
  <li>Betty Grof has escaped through a portal to 999 AMB, skipping the war. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>]</li>
  <li>Many native werewolves and vampires survive. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</li>
  <li>The penguin form of Orgalorg survives because he is immortal. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
  <li>Several tribes of humans survive. These are presumably those who were far enough away from the blasts and somehow managed to avoid the radiation. [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel, S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</li>
  <li>Randall N. Byron survives by uploading his consciousness into a computer program. [<em>Adventure Time #13</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Note: <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em> states that Simon remained in hibernation for hundreds of years, but it is now known that he emerged immediately after the end of the war.</p>
<p>Due to the increased elasticity, the world begins to change very rapidly. Hybrid creatures are able to be born, and a variety of extra-dimensional creatures begin to flood in through spontaneously formed portals. Rainicorns enter the world and begin a tradition of hunting and eating the surviving humans, who become their main source of food. Rainicorns are able to live off the sparse population thanks to the fact that they are capable of absorbing massive amounts of sustenance from a small amount of meat. [S02E12 <em>Her Parents</em>, S08E04 <em>Lady Rainicorn of the Crystal Dimension</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>There's enough nutrition in that macramé owl on the wall there to feed this entire city for a year!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Lee [S08E04 <em>Lady Rainicorn of the Crystal Dimension</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The Vampire Court comes out from its hiding and also begins hunting humans. The court consists of five powerful vampires: the Fool, the Empress, the Moon, the Heirophant, and the King. Many survivors are turned into mindless vampire minions who serve the higher members of the court. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>On top of all this, many humans become zombified or mutated by a mixture of radiation and magic, creating the oozers. Some zombified businessmen become preserved in an iceberg. [S05E14 <em>Simon & Marcy</em>, S01E08 <em>Business Time</em>]</p>
<p>The Super Porp company, a soda manufacturer, continues to operate. Humans are not needed thanks to full automation. [S06E29 <em>Dark Purple</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: In <em>Adventure Time #13</em>, it is stated that the war took place 1002 years before season 5. However, doing the relevant maths with this date would put the episode <em>Simon & Marcy</em> six years after the war, which doesn't make any sense. It would also cause the comet to hit four years after the war, which messes up a lot of dates. Therefore, this date has been disregarded.</p>
<hr>
<p class="note">Notes on the date of the war:</p>
<p class="note">Estimates for the real-life date of the war have varied anywhere from the 1970s to the 2040s, based on different sets of evidence. In my opinion, the most compelling and recent evidence indicates that the start of the war is between 2000 and 2008. Marceline owns a USB flash drive in <em>Ketchup</em>, which were invented in 2000 in real life. A crashed F&#8209;117 Nighthawk is seen in <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>, which were retired from service in 2008 in real life. <em>Adventure Time</em> began airing in 2010, which makes this a good estimation for the end of the war since it was probably intended to take place in the "present day".</p>
<p class="note">There is further evidence to support this time frame. A chart from <em>High Strangeness</em> appears to show world population over time. A massive dip is seen shortly after the year 2000, and the peak is just over six billion people, which was the approximate world population in that decade. The penny that Abraham Lincoln holds up when trying to bribe Death in <em>Sons of Mars</em> was minted in the year 20XX. The last two digits are obscured by dirt. Many characters use text speak like "BRB" and "OMG", which didn't become prevalent until the mid-2000s. The businessmen and Patience St Pim both have keypad mobile phones when they are thawed in <em>Business Time</em> and <em>Elemental</em>.</p>
<p class="note">Background artist Ghostshrimp stated in his podcast (<em>Ghostshrimp & Friends 049</em>) that he believes the Mushroom War is set in the crew's collective pasts, because that's what most of the creative input for the war is based on, without any set date in mind; hence the VHS tapes in his backgrounds, and the theme song from <em>Cheers</em> which was one of Kent Osborne's favourite shows. He accuses fans of being over-analytical. Personally, I have no idea what he's talking about.</p>
<p class="note">As previously discussed in the introduction, this timeline sets the Mushroom War to take place in 2010 CE for the purposes of assigning real life dates.</p>
<hr>
<p>During or shortly after the end of the Great Mushroom War, the Blue Catalyst Comet strikes the Earth and leaves behind its Agent of Change, which initially takes the form of a butterfly. The butterfly will eventually be reincarnated as Finn Mertens.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>A long time ago, I was you sorta. And I crashed on Earth and became a butterfly or some biz. And I guess it was just some random absurd thing. Just a joke I've been playing out for centuries.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Finn talking to the Purple Catalyst Comet [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
</div>
<p class="note">Note: The Blue Comet is probably the one that hits following the war because an object closely resembling it is seen missing the alternate version of Earth in <em>Finn the Human</em>. Also, Finn says "centuries", perhaps implying that it has been less than a millennium since his comet's arrival.</p>

<h3>In the Aftermath</h3>
<p>Simon, who by this point is much further into his transformation into the Ice King, travels around the ruins of the city for a while and eventually comes across the five year old Marceline, abandoned and crying in the street. He gives her a plush from a nearby toy store, which she names Hambo. [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>]</p>
<p>Marceline appears to have been left there by her mother, who leaves a note for anyone who finds her:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Whoever finds Marceline please care for her. Her father is Hunson Abadeer. When she is old enough she will find her way back. Please keep my baby safe. I can't care for her. Please help.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline's mother, in her note [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>In his diary, Simon describes a sentient mist that corrupts and mutates any survivors who are exposed to it and "hangs low like a London fog"; possibly an early formation of the Lich. He says that the dying survivors do not trust him due to his immunity, which is probably thanks to the crown. The sky lighting up again could be a reference to the Catalyst Comet. [S06E32 <em>Friends Forever</em>, <a href="simon's diary.txt">Simon's diary</a>]</p>
<p>Some survivors set up a refugee camp in an underground mall.</p>

<h3>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</h3>
<p>Simon and Marceline have begun to settle into their post-apocalyptic lifestyle. Simon becomes a father figure to Marceline in a way that her real father had never been. He gives Marceline a rudimentary education despite the fact that his mental state continues to deteriorate. They both practice kung fu using books they find. Simon begins writing a journal called <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>One day, the two venture into an abandoned city to try to find "chicken soup" to cure Marceline's fever. They get pursued and cornered by oozers and Simon is forced to use the crown for self-defence, using his powerful ice magic to defeat them. However, it further transforms him and his descent into madness accelerates. At the same time, a collective consciousness called the Mother Gum forms in the ruins and begins helping them. Marceline is seven years old at this point and Simon is forty-seven. [S05E14 <em>Simon & Marcy</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>There's a lot more of that pink substance growing and expanding in blobs and chunks all over the cityscape. A part of it seemed alive, seemed to look at me. How could a pink blob help us? How could this lifeless material know I needed help?</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his journal [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p class="note">Note: <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em> suggests that this takes place a few days after the end of the war, but it can actually be calculated to occur two years later: Marceline told the story to Finn and Jake two years before 1000 AMB, and the flashback card stated that it happened 996 years before then, meaning that this actually happened in 1000 - 2 - 996 = 2 AMB.</p>
<p class="note">"Chicken soup" might be Simon's word for medicine which he uses to make Marceline feel less worried, which would explain why the "food truck" they find resembles an ambulance. Because of this, Marceline might have false memories of believing the medicine to actually be chicken soup. However, in <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em> and <em>Season 11 #1</em> the chicken soup is explicitly mentioned, so this theory doesn't hold if those stories are considered canonical.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Marceline and Simon move into an abandoned penthouse apartment and see ghosts for the first time. It is possible that a low level Dead World briefly intersected with the material plane, and these ghosts were victims of the Great Mushroom War. It is also possible that this is when Simon begins to develop his "wizard eyes" which enable him to see into a dimension called the Spirit World. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S04E11 <em>Beyond this Earthly Realm</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Centuries from now, after the Great Mushroom War, many resources will be gone forever, and the world will regenerate anew with a wholly novel configuration of life-forms. And while wars create a dearth of resources, they also create an excess supply of ghosts. Thus, ghosts, a rarity in the ancient annals of Third Orb, shall become plentiful.</p>

<h3>The Demon and the Tidal Wave</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>We ended up in a bunch of tight jams, Marcy and me. I had to protect us from all kinds of marauding creatures and I had to put on the crown a couple dozen times over the past three years and it has taken its toll.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his journal [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>After realising that he is not going to be able to look after Marceline for much longer, Simon seeks a way to contact her father, Hunson Abadeer. He happens to come across a demon from the Nightosphere, who tells him that he was one of the creatures pulled through a portal to Earth following the war, and that his home dimension is the Nightosphere. Simon realises that this is where Marceline originates from.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I know I can control myself for a while longer but soon, weeks or months or years from now, when I finally lose it, I'll need someone to take care of her when I'm gone.

<p>Simon's condition becomes so bad that he is hardly able to remember and write about the day's events, so Marceline takes over writing <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>, and renames it to <em>Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>. She is ten years old at this point, and Simon is fifty.</p>
<p>Even though he stops writing the journal, Simon scribbles many of his thoughts and lyrics onto any bits of paper he can find. Some of them are notes to Marceline which she wouldn't get to read for a millennium to come.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, an enormous tidal wave hits the city for one of many possible reasons. The detonation of the Mushroom Bomb, the impact of the Catalyst Comet, or the general elasticity of the world could all be responsible. This is likely the beginning of the formation of the island continent that would eventually become known as the Land of Ooo. Simon and Marceline slowly and purposefully make their way to higher and higher ground, and for a while Marceline seems to enjoy the relative simplicity of her life. The need to keep moving and stay with Marceline seems to help Simon remain sane for a little while longer. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<h3>Simon's Departure</h3>
<p class="note">Note: All dates from now until Marceline's hibernation are complete guesses based on how old she looks.</p>
<p>Eventually the water stops rising, and Simon and Marceline arrive in another ruined city.</p>
<p>Ever since he first put it on, the crown has been urging Simon to re-establish Evergreen's realm of ice, so he finally decides to leave Marceline. To keep Marceline safe, he finds a way to reunite her with her father, Hunson Abadeer. He finds a copy of <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>, the book he co-authored with Betty Grof, and uses it to open a portal to the Nightosphere.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It was all there in the book, and even though I was losing my mind, I did it, Marceline! I completed the ritual! The portal actually opened! A rip between dimensions appeared. I saw Hunson and he saw me, each of us watching the other through a weird rip in the barrier that separates our two worlds. After I completed the binding spell on your dad the portal closed and everything went dark. God knows what I did. All I know is that I left you on my sled, headed north, where I will establish my kingdom, as in ancient times Gunther!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his note to Marceline [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Hunson and Simon briefly talk during their encounter, and Simon tells Hunson that the note left by Marceline's mother said he would know how to keep her safe. But Hunson says he is busy "quelling an uprising" and that he should tell Marceline to summon him herself later. The "binding spell" cast by Simon presumably ensures that Hunson and Marceline will someday meet each other. [<em>Marcy & Simon #3</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Simon records the last of his tapes as a message for the missing Betty, calling her his "princess". He also leaves Marceline with photos of her mother, and information on how to open a portal to the Nightosphere so that she can eventually summon her father. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: Marcy's scrapbook states that Simon only gave her two pictures of her mother, but in <em>Ketchup</em> she has an entire slideshow stored on an old USB drive. She must have obtained this from elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Marceline and Hunson</h3>
<p>After travelling on her own for a while, Marceline stalks two survivors who turn out to be thylacine werewolves named Remi and Rosella, who are proficient in the arcane arts. She befriends them and they agree to help her summon her father, Hunson Abadeer, since they believe he can help them vanquish the tribe of vampires that threatens their pack. Remi and Rosella successfully open a portal to the Nightosphere, and he bursts uninvited into Marceline's makeshift fort. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Marceline! Long time no see. Some goober with glasses summoned me. Let's go suck some souls!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Hunson Abadeer [S10E07 <em>Marcy & Hunson</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>To Marceline's horror, Hunson takes Remi and Rosella's souls, reducing them to lifeless husks. Despite this, she knows that this is probably her only opportunity to get to know her father:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Even though I hate him for sucking the life from my friends, I need to humour him because, let's face it, who knows what he could do? I can't let him know I don't like him. I can't write him off too quickly. Besides, he's the only one with the answers. There is still so much I don't know about myself and where I come from.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Their relationship becomes somewhat stable after a day at an abandoned carnival, and Marceline believes she is beginning to understand her father's motives. She inherits the Abadeer Axe, the weapon used by Hunson to take over the Nightosphere all those years ago:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>When I touched it, a strange feeling coursed through my veins, like a jolt of energy. This axe has some serious juju about it. Good or bad, I didn't really care. It's a gift from my Dad, and I will cherish it forever. Funny how your feelings can change so completely.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p class="note">Note: The graphic novel <em>Seeing Red</em> suggests that Hunson turned the axe into a bass guitar when he gave it to Marceline. This contradicts the episode <em>It Came from the Nightosphere</em> when Hunson says "Did you turn it into some kind of lute?" and is therefore false.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this friendship doesn't last long. Hunson says he wants to help the remaining werewolves with their vampire problem, so they track down the rest of the pack to a truck stop on Route 90. In a repeat of his previous actions, he wipes out the entire werewolf pack and claims that he "helped" them, since the vampires would have killed them anyway. Upset with him, Marceline goes into the truck stop and manages to make fries, but Hunson eats them. This is the last straw. In a rage, Marceline banishes him back to the Nightosphere, abruptly ending his nine day visit. She writes the <em>Fry Song</em> shortly after. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: An interview with Marceline seen in <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em> gives a completely different story regarding the fry incident. It's possible she made the story up to avoid the truth.</p>

<h3>Schwabl and Daniel</h3>
<p>Marceline returns to the abandoned mall where she spent some time with Simon before he left her. All of the survivors who used to inhabit it have either perished or moved away by this time. She meets a dog that somehow managed to survive on the food in the mall's pet shop, and names it Schwabl. Having spent so much of her life dealing with complicated people like Simon and her father, Schwabl is a nice change of pace. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline talking to Schwabl [<em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>At some point around this time, Marceline converts the Abadeer Axe into an electric bass guitar and learns to play it, although she is still able to proficiently wield it as a weapon as well. She also becomes familiar with human technology and learns how to use computers. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>Adventure Time #13</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: This is somewhat contradicted by <em>Broke His Crown</em>, in which Marceline hints several times that she doesn't understand any of the computer equipment that Bubblegum is using.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, she meets a unicorn called Daniel while sleepwalking. He is killed by vampires and Marceline pledges to avenge him. This is possibly a dream, but nevertheless Marceline sets out to track down and kill all the vampires she can. She learns to fight from books in the mall library. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world is beginning to lapse into an ice age. This is probably caused by a combination of Simon establishing his realm of ice and some kind of magic-induced nuclear winter:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Simon had once told me that after the war, we might be in for a magical cataclysm. He said it might take the form of a very long global winter that could last for several hundred years.</p>

<h3>Marceline the Vampire Hunter</h3>
<p>Marceline stakes her first vampire, a simple minion who was trying to murder a sheep. She also stakes a vampire who was threatening a family of human survivors, but the survivors run away before she can talk to them. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S07E09 <em>The Empress Eyes</em>]</p>
<p>Before long, she is a proficient vampire hunter and manages to force a stake through the heart of the first member of the Vampire Court, the Fool. She realises that she is capable of using her demon soul-sucking ability to absorb his soul and his powers, and gains from him the ability to fly. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>Later, while trying to catch food, she accidentally lassos a young human girl wearing a bunny hat, who runs away from her. She stalks her and discovers an entire tribe of survivors, who wear animal hats to protect their necks from vampire bites. They are led by a man named Two Bread Tom, and the bunny girl is named Jo. They initially run away from Marceline because of her sharp demon teeth and her ability to fly, but eventually come to trust her. She becomes good friends with Jo. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>Islands</em> graphic novel]</p>
<p>At some point, the second member of the Vampire Court, the Empress, meets Simon and tricks him into doing her bidding. Marceline stakes the Empress, steals her soul, and gains from her the power of invisibility. It is unknown whether or not she meets back up with Simon during this ordeal.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>If you really cared about him, why'd you let him degenerate into this pathetic clown character? He used to have more of a silver fox thing going on with his hair and those cute glasses. He was happier then, you know. When he was serving me.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Empress talking to Marceline [S07E09 <em>The Empress Eyes</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Marceline decides to take a personal journey away from the tribe to visit the city where Simon abandoned her, perhaps hoping to recapture the happier times of her life which she spent with him. To her surprise, she meets a second tribe of humans there, including two children named Rock and Twiggy who are almost certainly young enough to have been born after the war. They spend their time hiding from a member of the Vampire Court named the Moon, so Marceline stakes her and absorbs her soul and her self-healing powers, meaning that she can sustain serious injuries without being permanently harmed. However, the tribe moves away without knowing what Marceline did for them. Their fates are unknown. [<em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</p>
<p>A month later, back with the first tribe, Two Bread Tom tells Marceline that they will not be able to stay on the mainland even if she kills all the vampires because of changing atmospheric conditions and the incoming magical nuclear winter. Their plan is to refurbish a large pre-war cargo ship.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It's not just the vampires, or the oozers, or them hungry-looking rainbows. The latest atmospheric readings are going bananas. Something big is coming, and it's gonna change all this. No, we'd do best to clear out of this continent altogether.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Two Bread Tom [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The tribe is suddenly attacked by the last of the vampires and is forced to set sail as soon as possible. Marceline stakes and sucks the soul of the Heirophant, absorbing his shape-shifting powers. This leaves the Vampire King as the very last of his kind. However, just as she is forcing her stake through his heart, he bites her neck and transforms her into a vampire herself. The Vampire King is killed and Marceline proclaims the full title of "Marceline the Vampire Queen". The humans set sail without her. [S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: The comic miniseries <em>Marceline and the Scream Queens</em> features a vampire character named Keila. This has since been contradicted because Marceline is the last of her kind. Some of the other comics also suggest that Marceline is actually a ruler due to her title, but this is false.</p>
<p>Marceline realises that she is allergic to sunlight and craves the colour red. She becomes immortal and stops ageing in her late teens. After accidentally draining the blood from Schwabl, she tracks down the group of wizards who obtained the Enchiridion and steals it from them. She uses a resurrection spell on Schwabl, turning him into an immortal undead creature just like her. Necromancy is added to her growing repertoire of supernatural abilities. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: Marcy's scrapbook shows that Schwabl was red before Marceline became a vampire, but the <em>Stakes</em> miniseries and the <em>2015 Spoooktacular</em> show that he has always been white.</p>
<p>Due to the advancing global winter, Marceline decides to use her undead powers to hibernate until it is over. She falls asleep in a cave with Schwabl, and uses the Enchiridion as a pillow. She remains in this state until the winter is over. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<h3>The Foundation of the Human Islands</h3>
<p>The human tribe sets sail without Marceline and heads south-west. On the thirty-third day of their voyage, the ship is attacked by sea monsters, but they are able to fend off the creatures. The next day, they arrive on a large island where they meet up with another tribe of humans. The leaders of the tribes begin fabricating a new society and name their new home "Founders' Island". [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel]</p>
<p class="note">Note: If the name of the island refers to just a single founder (i.e. Two Bread Tom) then the apostrophe would be placed like so: "Founder's Island". However, the name probably refers to multiple founders, and therefore the apostrophe should be placed after the word, like so: "Founders' Island". It is spelt the second way in the official cookbook, so that's what I'm going with.</p>
<p>A while later, once the humans have established a sizeable colony, Jo (Marceline's friend), Two Bread Tom, and an islander named Michiko embark on an expedition to explore more of the island. Jo gets abducted by a giant bird and carried to the other side of the island, and spends weeks making her way back again. Tom decides that, to avoid losing anyone else, the islanders should construct a guardian to kill anything that tries to enter or leave the Islands. When Jo returns, she disagrees with his plans to seal off the island, so she and a group of the other islanders rebel and split from the main group.</p>

<p>The humans on the Islands are able to survive the magical nuclear winter. Over the course of the next millennium, they rebuild their society to a level beyond pre-war technology. They reinvent cars, robotics, computers, flying machines, advanced medical technology, geoengineering and much more. At some point, a MO Co airship arrives at the Islands, so it's likely that MO Co helps design the final version of the Guardian. The animal hats originally worn by the tribe members to protect against vampire bites remain an important part of their culture and a symbol of their highly protective attitude. The tribe leaders, including Two Bread Tom, become deified in the islanders' mythology as the legendary "Founders", while Jo and the other splitters eventually become derogatorily known as "hiders" who try to escape the Islands.

<p>A chunk of the western former United States becomes isolated and forms the small island continent of Ooo.

Tired of his niece's control issues, Gumbald devises a plan to depose Bonnibel by creating a potion called "Dum Dum Juice" that will render her completely stupid and unable to meddle in his plans. He creates Mr. Cream Puff as a love interest for Bonnibel to distract her, then double-crosses Molly and Chicle by testing the Dum Dum Juice on them, transforming them into the candy people who would later become known as Manfried and Crunchy.

<h3>Marceline and Bonnibel</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Marceline, word has it you're more than a thousand years old. Does that mean you spend a lot of time on the Internet checking for obituaries and going to friends' funerals? I mean, they must die, like, every week!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc"><em>Teen Zine</em> [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Marceline wakes up from her long hibernation, and is still alive thanks to the fact that vampires don't age. She meets Bonnibel Bubblegum, who by this point is preparing to construct her kingdom. Somehow, the Enchiridion that Marceline was carrying ends up stowed away on Mount Cragdor. It's possible that Marceline shows it to Bubblegum, who recognises its importance and has it protected. [S01E05 <em>The Enchiridion!</em>]</p>
<p>Despite their very opposite personalities, Marceline and Bubblegum become good friends thanks to their mutual longevity and eventually begin dating. Marceline takes Bubblegum to her first punk show where someone spills food down her shirt, so Marceline buys her a new shirt from the merchandise counter to cover the stain. Despite hating the actual show, the shirt becomes Bubblegum's most treasured possession. [SDCC 2018: <em>P.B. & Marcy</em>, S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S05E29 <em>Sky Witch</em>]</p>
<p>They would also sometimes explore the candy mines together. After a lot of persuasion, Marceline manages to get Bubblegum to graffiti on the walls. [S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>, <em>Adventure Time Comics #23: "Forever (Not) Alone"</em>]</p>
<p>At around this time, Bubblegum digs up two gemstones, one red and one blue, which crashed to Earth millions of years ago. She turns them into magic amulets (not to be confused with the Time Amulet); the red one can shoot lasers and the blue one can bring robots to life. She gives the red one to Marceline and keeps the blue one for herself. [<em>Adventure Time #25</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: In the comics, Marceline is shown living in the Tree Fort at this time, which doesn't make any sense since this happens before Shoko's death. Also, it is implied that Bubblegum didn't create the candy people or claim the title of princess until after she met Marceline, which is now known to be false as shown in <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>.</p>
<p>Finn and Jake arrive during the construction of the Candy Kingdom while travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point. Marceline and Bubblegum are still on good terms at this point. Marceline gives them the Time Amulet which she has been holding ever since the last time Finn and Jake visited her, back when she was travelling with Simon. Since Marceline and Finn and Jake met each other in opposite order, the Time Amulet is actually an example of a causal loop, or a bootstrap paradox, having manifested from nothing with no true origin. The Time Amulet helps Finn and Jake to find their way home. [<em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>
<p class="note">Note: This sequence of events suggests that Marceline should already recognise Finn and Jake when they first meet in <em>Evicted!</em> However, it's possible that she eventually forgets her strange past encounters with these strangers.</p>
<p>Marceline and Bubblegum fall out after Bubblegum becomes too obsessed with politics and building her kingdom and isn't able to make time for her friend anymore. [S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>, <em>Adventure Time #25</em>, <em>Marceline Gone Adrift #4</em>]</p>

<p>It's likely that Marceline goes back into hibernation multiple times, which would explain why her mental age doesn't seem to be that much older than her apparent physical age, and why she is still upset with her father about the fry incident nearly a thousand years after it occurred. [S02E01 <em>It Came from the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>She begins writing her angsty five hundred year journal at around this time, and also begins writing her annual hourly comics in 735 AMB. She claims to have been in a gang with three ghosts named Wendy, Booboo, and Georgie. Marceline might have also had a second dog named Pickles at some point, in addition to Schwabl.

<p>Shoko is a reincarnation of the Blue Catalyst Comet and a previous life of Finn Mertens. When she is young, her parents apparently trade her right arm for a computer and then abandon her in a dojo, and she ends up becoming a freelance thief. [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</p>
<p>She has a pet tiger who happens to be a previous life of Jake the dog. [<a href="http://archive.is/hLB0t">Andy Ristaino's Spring</a>]</p>
<p>At one point, she meets the Ice King and frees him from a group of evil lunch ladies. [<em>Adventure Time #50</em>]</p>
<p>Around five hundred years after the Mushroom War, she is hired by the Bath Boy Gang to steal Princess Bubblegum's Blue Amulet, so she knocks herself out and gets taken into care within the walls of the fledgling Candy Kingdom, where she befriends Princess Bubblegum. She helps her complete her secret project, the Gumball Guardians, powerful robots that are charged with protecting the Candy Kingdom from evil. Bubblegum activates them using the power of the Blue Amulet. [<em>Ghostshrimp & Friends 049</em>, S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</p>
<p>Despite the initial plan, Shoko becomes conflicted about completing the job after Bubblegum gifts her a new robotic arm. However, she goes through with it anyway and attempts to steal the amulet while Bubblegum is asleep. She is spotted and attacked by the Gumball Guardians, who send her hurtling into the radioactive river which still surrounds the kingdom. Mutated and disfigured, but endowed with a new biological arm, Shoko crawls away and dies under the sapling of a willow tree.</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Finn [<em>Princess and Princess</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>While Princess Bubblegum often comes across as a benevolent and carefree leader, the early Candy Kingdom is not as sweet as its name might suggest. She is largely feared by her subjects due to the fact that the story of the first candy people becomes warped and corrupted, framing Gumbald as the victim and Bonnibel as the enemy:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>She's an unknowable goddess. When the first candy people rose against her, she transformed them into hideous monsters. Her own brother Neddy: she imprisoned him beneath the great tree. And the rattleball boys? She iced all those guys. She's amazing, and she's flippin' scary.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Banana Guard 16 [S07E26 <em>The Thin Yellow Line</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>This reputation is not helped by several questionable authoritarian actions taken by Bubblegum in the early years of her reign. In order to enforce the law within the fledgling candy kingdom, Bubblegum first creates the Banana Guard. However, they are largely ineffective, so she invents a more serious police force, the aforementioned rattleballs:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. Our righteous swords cut a swathe through the chaos, but we were too successful. Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational, and sentenced to death. I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Rattleballs [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Bubblegum takes extreme action by having all of them executed, and reinstates the Banana Guard. Rattleballs is the only unit to escape. He leaves the walls of the kingdom and goes to live in hiding in the dump. [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
<p>In her controlling paranoia, Bubblegum also establishes mass surveillance networks in her kingdom to watch her citizens and track their every move, although it is not known when exactly she establishes these. It might not have been until a much later point. [S04E20 <em>You Made Me</em>, S06E15 <em>Nemesis</em>, S06E22 <em>The Cooler</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<p>Despite all this, the Candy Kingdom becomes the most stable, safe, and powerful state in Ooo. Under the protection of the Gumball Guardians it grows into a prosperous nation. Bubblegum creates an electricity grid by harnessing the energy of the liquid produced by her brother Neddy, decontaminating the radioactive river in the process. Her territory expands to encompass a large portion of the grasslands. She builds a grand castle and spends a lot of her time locked up inside studying science. [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>, S07E01 <em>Bonnie and Neddy</em>, S04E16 <em>Burning Low</em>, S05E21 <em>The Suitor</em>]</p>
<p>In addition to the banana guards and the Gumball Guardians, she instates the Royal Hero Draft, a scheme to recruit warriors and heroes who will defend the kingdom. It is likely that Billy and later Finn and Jake will become champions of the kingdom through this scheme. [<em>Candy Capers #1</em>]</p>

<p>MO Co existed before the war and survived thanks to Moe becoming a cyborg. His factory is constructed in the Desert Lands. Moe builds many robots in his "MO" range for various purposes. The two most notable are AMO, who is built to receive love, and BMO, who is built to provide it. AMO is neglected by Moe and goes insane from a lack of love, so he decides to leave the factory on a pilgrimage. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>, S07E15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know Part 2</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need, such is the cruel physics of love that those who crave it most will repel it, and only the dang rich get richer.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">ALLMO [S07E15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know Part 2</em>]</p>

<p>BMO also leaves the factory. He would eventually end up living with Finn and Jake.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son, but I guess I never ended up dating any women, so that's that. I sent BMO off into the world alone, hoping he could find a family of his own. Maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Moseph Giovanni [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>]</p>

<p>Moe builds many more MOs to populate his factory and to look after him as he becomes older and older.

<p class="note">Note: BMO is genderless, but uses male pronouns when talking about himself in the third person in <em>Football</em>. Most other characters also assign him male pronouns. In <em>Angel Face</em>, which takes place in 1000 AMB, BMO claims that he is old enough to vote. Assuming that the voting age in Ooo is eighteen, the latest possible date of BMO's creation is therefore 982 AMB. However, he is probably much older than this given he was built before the Sleeping Fire Giants.</p>

Furthermore, he is responsible for the construction of legendary machines known as the Sleeping Fire Giants. [S07E15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know Part 2</em>]</p>

<p>The Fire Giants ignite the Fire Kingdom in the south of Ooo, allowing for the rise of the flame people. By 1000 AMB, the Fire Kingdom is one of the most powerful states in Ooo, perhaps second only to the Candy Kingdom. It is unknown what Moe's motives were for building such machines in the first place.</p>
<p>Eventually, the documentation for how to operate the Fire Giants is lost. They lie dormant in the catacombs of the Fire Kingdom for centuries. [<em>Beginning of the End #2</em>]</p>
<p>The history of the Fire Kingdom is one full of conspiracy, treachery, and regicide. One member of the royal family, who would later become known as "Flame King", plots to take the Red Throne by murdering the impeding heirs until it is rightfully his. A flame guard named Leroy assists in overthrowing seven different rulers to allow Flame King to eventually rise to power. One of those rulers is Flame King's brother, who is murdered by Flame King. His children Furnius and Torcho swear vengeance upon their uncle. [<em>Finn & Jake Investigations</em>, S04E22 <em>Ignition Point</em>]</p>

<h3>The Other Kingdoms</h3>
<p>Numerous other kingdoms and states begin to crop up all over Ooo. Most of them are tiny and remain under the effective jurisdiction of the Candy Kingdom, such as the Hot Dog Kingdom. However, a few are large enough to rival it. Most notable among these are the aforementioned Fire Kingdom, the Slime Kingdom, and Wizard City. The princesses and other leaders form various political organisations to keep the peace. Princess Bubblegum, ruler of the Candy Kingdom, does her best to remain the de facto dictator of Ooo through a combination of excellent diplomacy and some other shadier dealings.</p>

<p>The Slime Kingdom eventually falls under the rule of Slime Princess, who is the reincarnation of the Slime Elemental following the death of the previous one in the Great Mushroom War. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>Most kingdoms are ruled by a leader with the title "princess", even though prior to the war this title was used only by female heirs. This is because Bubblegum chose to adopt the title in revenge for Gumbald mockingly calling her "prinzessin". It's likely that the other kingdom founders follow suit. [S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>However, some kingdoms including Lumpy Space and the Fire Kingdom continue to use the title in the traditional sense, with the actual rulers being called kings and queens. [S01E02 <em>Trouble in Lumpy Space</em>, S03E26 <em>Incendium</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum probably distributes the Gems of Power from the Enchiridion to some of the other royals for safekeeping. They all attach the gems to their crowns, including Bubblegum who keeps one for herself, granting them immunity to the Lich's telepathic abilities. [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: One of the Gems of Power is a gem from Evergreen's crown, even though the crown gems are known to have a different origin.</p>

<p>In his grief and madness over the loss of Margles, Magic Man has spent the past few millennia tormenting the people of Mars. Most notoriously, he creates three plagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Plague of Shadows causes people's shadows to come to life and attack them.</li>
<li>The Plague of the Oneness causes every Martian to become stuck hand in hand.</li>
<li>The Plague of Hair causes all the water to turn into hair. The Martians get so thirsty that they drink it, and it makes them go bald, hence why many of them wear "groovy headgear".</li>
</ul>
<p>His last act against the Martians is chaining them all together and driving over them with a school bus as a literal enactment of "throwing them under the bus". After escaping from the chains, Abraham Lincoln gives up trying to reason with Magic Man and finally sentences him to banishment. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, S08E07 <em>Normal Man</em>]</p>

<p>The Earl of Lemongrab is an over-sensitive psychopathic creature who doesn't seem too pleased with the fact that he is alive, and he certainly isn't fit to rule the kingdom. However, rather than executing him as might have been the case earlier in the kingdom's history, Bubblegum instead gives him his own empty earldom to rule over. He remains the heir to the Candy Kingdom throne by law. [S03E05 <em>Too Young</em>]</p>
<p>The Gum is also given a small kingdom to rule over, although it's actually just a hole in the ground. [<em>Adventure Time #24</em>]</p>

<h3>The One True King of Ooo</h3>
<p>A member of a hive of wax hustlers travels the land proclaiming the title "King of Ooo". He claims to be over eight thousand years old, but this is almost certainly a lie. He meets a dog from the Crystal Dimension named Toronto who becomes his attorney and secretary, and together they gain a cult following by conning people into believing they are true royalty. He is a constant annoyance to Princess Bubblegum, who frequently denounces him as the fraud that he is. Despite this, many residents of Ooo still follow him without question.

Upon returning to the mainland and giving up piracy, Tree Trunks invests her pirate treasure into establishing a large-scale shipping business which has strong ties with MO Co. She falls in love with her secretary, a seal named Wyatt.

<p>The Islands are locked off to the rest of the world. Nobody is allowed to enter or leave, and many of the hiders who try to escape are killed by the Guardian. Others are captured by the "seekers", genetically engineered super-humans who prevent people from leaving the Islands' shores and send captured hiders to re-education. The seekers have implants in the side of their heads which can be used to feed information directly into their brains. These implants are engineered by their mentor Doctor Gross, and they also serve the secret function of giving her complete authority over her seekers' actions without their permission.

<p>All children born on the Islands are given a function from early childhood, and Kara Strong (designation "Seeker X-J-7-7") is destined to be a seeker.

While she is still a baby, the Flame King hears a prophecy that her powers will be far greater than his own, and so has her cast out into the wilderness to perish for fear of being usurped. However, his squire takes pity on the child and leaves her in the care of a lumberjack near the Candy Kingdom. Phoebe, who doesn't know any better, burns down his house and begins carving a path through the forest. After a destructive rampage through Ooo, she reaches the Candy Kingdom and is returned to the Fire Kingdom by Princess Bubblegum:</p>

However, Tree Trunks was already living in the Candy Kingdom with Wyatt at the time of Jake's birth as shown in <em>Joshua & Margaret Investigations</em>. For Tree Trunks to have been captain of <em>La Femme du la Mer</em> at the time of Martin's escape, either she would have had to build and sell off her company in a matter of months, or Finn is significantly older than Jake, neither of which seem plausible.

<p>Gata wanders the land and ends up climbing in through Joshua and Margaret's window. They decide to raise her as a sister to Jake and Jermaine. Later on, after Finn has also joined the family, Joshua closes the portal in his adopted daughter's mouth by using a magical item which turns her into a stone statue and erases her from the memories of everyone who knew about her. Her entire family forgets that she ever existed. [<em>Adventure Time #48</em>]</p>

<h3>The Time Slips</h3>
<p>In the future, a creature called Clock Bear escapes from Doctor Gross' menagerie and hides out in the attic of Joshua and Margaret's private investigation bureau. He causes several "time slips" between the 980s and 1001 AMB, making the house seem haunted. This also allows the future versions of Finn and Jake to subtly interact with their dead parents, and future Jake witnesses his own unconventional birth. [S10E08 <em>The First Investigation</em>]</p>

<h3>Finn, Jake and Jermaine's Upbringing</h3>
<p>At some point, the family moves out of the investigation bureau in the city and into a large house atop a hill in the countryside. [<em>Adventure Time #48</em>, S10E08 <em>The First Investigation</em>]</p>
<p>While the boys seem to have a fairly close relationship with their parents, things are not as simple as they might seem. Margaret is overprotective of her children and limits their freedoms. On the other hand, Joshua is eager for his children to become adventurers like him and designs deadly dungeons for them to take part in. He even teaches Jake how to pickpocket. This combination probably makes for an unhealthy family dynamic and could be responsible for Jake's later criminality.

  <p>Everyone leaves. Except me. I remember father made me stay at the table until all the eggs were eaten.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Jake [S09E04 <em>Winter Light</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, Jermaine appears to take a back seat behind his two brothers. He isn't a powerful shape-shifter or an exotic human, so his parents seem to show less interest in him than in their other two boys. He is once accidentally knocked out by Jake while they are play-fighting. Jermaine probably craves attention from his parents, which might explain why he's the one who would later stay and look after the house following their death. [S02E08 <em>Crystals Have Power</em>, S06E33 <em>Jermaine</em>]</p>
<p>Both parents also keep secrets from their children. They never tell Jake the true origin of his powers or that Margaret is not his biological mother. Jake grows up believing that he gained his powers from rolling in a magic mud puddle and Finn grows up believing he was born from a cabbage. [S06E16 <em>Joshua & Margaret Investigations</em>, S01E14 <em>The Witch's Garden</em>, S01E22 <em>Henchman</em>]</p>
<p>However, it wasn't all bad. All three children clearly loved their parents.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Ah man, my dad use to make pickles. It's all he use to talk about. He'd obsess about them all the time. When I'd come in from playing he'd be like, "Here, Jake, try these!"

Chauncey mocks the witch for her habit of speaking in rhymes, for which she curses him with the same affliction and alters his body to look sillier.

After passing all the trials Finn and Jake take the book home, but they hardly ever read it. The only time Finn is ever seen reading it is to find a cure for his and Jake's injuries so that he can get rid of the clown nurses who Jake has hired.

<p class="note">Note: It is not clear whether or not this is the first time Marceline has seen her father since banishing him after the fry incident. The comic <em>Marceline and the Scream Queens</em> heavily implies that Marceline has spent a lot of time in the Nightosphere in the past. This is further evidenced in the episode <em>Heat Signature</em> by the fact that Marceline mentions she used to be in a gang in the "Underworld", which could be synonymous with the Nightosphere. She also says during <em>Finn & Jake Investigations</em> that she once attended music school in the Nightosphere, but this could have been after reuniting with her father.</p>

<h3>Jake's New Life</h3>
<p>While Jake enjoys his new life as an adventurer alongside Finn, he begins to find himself juggling the various aspects of his life. Balancing his relationship with Lady and his relationship with Finn proves to be challenging for him.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I'm fed up, Shelby. Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn. And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missing out on Lady Rainicorn.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Jake [S01E09 <em>My Two Favorite People</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Jake successfully manages to get Finn and Lady to hang out with him at the same time, but he begins to worry that the two have grown too close. He calls Tiffany, an old member of his gang of criminals, to try to make them both jealous. Jake eventually makes up with Finn and Lady, but not before Tiffany pledges to kill Finn and take back his place as Jake's best friend. Finn chases him off for now. [S01E09 <em>My Two Favorite People</em>]</p>
<p>In addition to this, Jake struggles to hide his former criminality from Finn. When they visit the City of Thieves, Jake has to pretend to "accidentally" steal a pair of boots to provide an excuse for the fact that he can't pass through the anti-thief barrier surrounding the king's tower, even though the actual reason is due to his criminal past. [S01E13 <em>City of Thieves</em>]</p>
<p>All of this is not helped by the fact that Jake has an extremely short attention span. He knows that he has a responsibility to look after Finn, but he often fails to fulfil that responsibility, such as when he allows Finn to be captured by the gnomes who live beneath the Tree Fort. His powers have made him lazy, and when they are temporarily taken away from him by a witch he is completely unmotivated and can't be bothered to do anything about it. Finn claims that Jake always messes up his plans, which is why he doesn't tell him his plan to escape the Fight King's arena. [S02E07 <em>Power Animal</em>, S01E14 <em>The Witch's Garden</em>, S03E02 <em>Morituri Te Salutamus</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I never really take anything seriously. Except Kompy's Kastle.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Jake [S04E21 <em>Who Would Win?</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Jake's relaxed attitude also causes him to be quite accepting of his own mortality at this time. For example, he was willing to risk his life to get to the wishes at the centre of the Labyrinth. He is shown to put other people's lives ahead of his own, such as his refusal to murder Wildberry Princess even though he knew that the assassin Me-Mow would poison him if he didn't. Thankfully, he was able to use his powers to fight off Me-Mow's poison. [S02E22 <em>The Limit</em>, S03E16 <em>Jake vs. Me-Mow</em>]</p>
<p>One day, Jake has a dream where he dies in space alongside a mysterious Banana Man. Since the Cosmic Owl is present, Jake realises that this dream must be his prophetic croak dream, and believes that his imminent death is inevitable. He spends the following day trying to fulfil the dream and accept his fate. He and Finn meet the mysterious Banana Man, who turns out to be one of their neighbours, and Jake tries to steal his rocket to fulfil the dream. Luckily it doesn't have enough power to get into space. Instead, Jake nearly drowns in a cavern beneath the launch site, but is saved by Finn. The prophecy remains to come true another day...

<h3>Princess Bubblegum of the Candy Kingdom</h3>
<p>Despite being a powerful state, the Candy Kingdom comes under considerable threat from a variety of problems, including two zombie outbreaks, a freezer burn flu epidemic, an attempted hyooman invasion, and a successful invasion by an evil stag. Fortunately, Finn and Jake are able to save the day in each case, but it is not known why the kingdom so frequently has to resort to their help. [S01E01 <em>Slumber Party Panic</em>, S03E13 <em>From Bad to Worse</em>, S01E24 <em>What Have You Done?</em>, S02E18 <em>Susan Strong</em>, S03E15 <em>No One Can Hear You</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>And despite all my preparation, despite my greatest efforts, despite a nation's armament and my kingdom's best defences, in the end I still had to rely on a kid and this dog he knows to fix all my problems. Hah!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Princess Bubblegum [<em>Adventure Time #24</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Finn's unrequited crush on Princess Bubblegum continues to develop. One day, Finn and Jake meet a witch who traps Jake in her "bottomless bottom" under the condition that Finn must bring her a lock of princess hair. Finn sets up a date with Princess Bubblegum and manages to get a wad of her hair, but the witch rejects it since it is actually made of bubblegum. Luckily, the witch instead accepts Finn's own hair and releases Jake. Finn gets to keep the wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair, and it becomes his most treasured possession. [S02E10 <em>To Cut a Woman's Hair</em>, S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>]</p>
<p>One of Finn's main shortcomings when it comes to courting the princess is his inability to match her intellect. One of the few times she ever kisses him is after he uses the Glasses of Nerdicon to make himself super-intelligent and summon a black hole. Finn loses the glasses after they fall into the black hole, and also loses Scarlet, his sword, while closing it. Princess Bubblegum also kisses him after he wins the Wizard Battle to "save" her from being kissed by the Ice King or another wizard named Abracadaniel. [S01E07 <em>Ricardio the Heart Guy</em>, S02E15 <em>The Real You</em>, S03E08 <em>Wizard Battle</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Princess Bubblegum's relationship with Marceline remains sour. Bubblegum usually does her best to ignore Marceline, so Marceline often deliberately tries to get on her nerves. The fact that Marceline deliberately messes up Finn's attempts to ask Bubblegum to the movies suggests that she still feels some attachment to her. [S02E20 <em>Go With Me</em>]</p>

<h3>The Misunderstood Ice King</h3>
<p>Simon Petrikov, now completely fallen to the insanity of Evergreen's crown, has become known to everyone but Marceline as "the Ice King". Some echo of his old self still desperately hopes for Betty to return to him, and as a result he is always trying to fill the void of his love life by kidnapping princesses, with Princess Bubblegum being his most frequent victim.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.</p>
  <p>Well why'd you capture six of them if you just wanna marry one?</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Ice King and Jake [S01E03 <em>Prisoners of Love</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>He frequently comes up with plans to capture and marry princesses. These plans include hypnotising Old Lady Princess, shaving his beard to pretend to be a different person, kidnapping Doctor Princess under the guise of Gunter's pregnancy, and cheating his way through Wizard Battle for the chance to kiss Princess Bubblegum. His plans are always thwarted by Finn and Jake. [S01E17 <em>When Wedding Bells Thaw</em>, S02E03 <em>Loyalty to the King</em>, S02E11 <em>The Chamber of Frozen Blades</em>, S03E08 <em>Wizard Battle</em>]</p>
<p>Despite all this, Ice King believes himself to be a good person. He is jealous of Finn and Jake's relationships, and desperately tries to make friends with them so he can learn how to be a better person. Unfortunately his methods for doing so are usually unintentionally creepy or malevolent, but ultimately he has no intention to harm anyone. [S01E24 <em>What Have You Done?</em>, S02E02 <em>The Eyes</em>, S03E04 <em>Hitman</em>, S03E07 <em>Still</em>, S04E11 <em>Beyond This Earthly Realm</em>]</p>
<p>Ice King also attempts to connect with Finn and Jake by writing his own gender-swapped fan-fictions about them, titled <em>Fionna and Cake</em>. The existence of tapes containing "episodes" of a television show with the same name suggests that this might have been an actual show before the Great Mushroom War which Ice King is inexplicably connected to. He claims that ideas for the stories are beamed into his brain while he sleeps at night, which might actually be true. One account suggests that the origin of these information beams is a satellite named FELIS. Plausibly, this could be the origin of the mysterious anachronistic tapes as well. Ice King eventually becomes so obsessed with his stories that he refuses to allow them to be criticised, and desperately wants them to come true. [S03E09 <em>Fionna and Cake</em>, S09E12 <em>Fionna and Cake and Fionna</em>, <em>Beginning of the End #3</em>, <a href="https://tedlyanderson.tumblr.com/post/180638139224/annotations-for-adventure-time-beginning-of-the">Ted Anderson's Tumblr</a>, S05E08 <em>Mystery Dungeon</em>, S05E11 <em>Bad Little Boy</em>]</p>
<p>Ice King sends some of his <em>Fionna and Cake</em> stories to a magazine called Ble, but upon visiting their offices and getting past the Pudding Troll, he discovers that all of the employees mysteriously died over five hundred years ago, and his submissions have just been lying in a heap by the front door. [S10E09 <em>Blenanas</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: It's possible that the employees were already dead by the time the Pudding Troll was employed to guard the building, so the magazine might actually have ceased production before or during the Mushroom War. This would explain why the skeletons appear to be human and why the offices are in pre-war ruins. This is further evidenced by the fact that <em>Bletters to the Bleditor</em>, a piece in the SDCC 2018 crew zine, makes reference to several real world pre-war locations, such as Las Vegas and London.</p>
<p>Finn and Jake eventually learn about Ice King's tragic past by watching the tapes Simon made about his spiralling descent into madness. They come to see Ice King in a new light, and he begins to become an ally and a friend to Finn and Jake. [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p>Gunter, the penguin form of Orgalorg, still lives with the Ice King along with various other normal penguins. He gives birth to some kind of magical kitten. Ice King is largely neglectful towards Gunter which leads to Gunter stealing his demonic wishing eye and almost managing to use it to overrun the Candy Kingdom, hinting at his darker side.

<h3>Drama in Lumpy Space</h3>
<p>By 996 AMB, Lumpy Space Princess is fourteen years old and fresh out of a breakup with her ex-boyfriend Brad, who has gone on to date her "best friend" Melissa. Though she appears to revel in the teenage drama of her home life, she recognises that most of the relationships she holds in Lumpy Space are unsubstantial or fake, and as a result she begins making frequent interdimensional trips to the Land of Ooo where she meets and somewhat befriends Finn and Jake.</p>

</div>
<p>After her quinceañera (fifteenth birthday), LSP has a particularly bad argument with her parents. For one reason or another she runs away from home to live in the Land of Ooo. It is not certain whether she does this because she is sick of living in Lumpy Space or because she just wants to create more drama. Either way, she ends up homeless and camping in the woods, eating beans and roadkill. [S02E02 <em>The Eyes</em>, S02E10 <em>To Cut a Woman's Hair</em>, S02E26 <em>Heat Signature</em>, <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
<p>Over the next few years, LSP returns home and then runs away several more times. After one particular argument, she is briefly adopted by a pack of wolves and then pretends to be a monster so that she can steal crops from a village. Finn and Jake find her and manage to get her to reconcile with her parents, but she continues to live as a homeless person whenever she visits Ooo. She usually camps in the woods, but also spends a lot of time living in the "Coolest Hotel".

<p>LSP maintains several other relationships within the Land of Ooo; both good and bad. One of her best friends is Turtle Princess, the ruler of the library. One of her most notable nemeses is Breakfast Princess. [S04E12 <em>Gotcha!</em>, <em>Adventure Time #3: "Bacon Fields"</em>, S06E14 <em>Princess Day</em>]</p>
<p>Unlike many other characters, Lumpy Space Princess never really gets any kind of redemption or change of character. After all, stubbornness is a key component of elemental lumpiness. However, LSP is shown to become a little more mature over the course of the time she spends in the Land of Ooo. It seems like Finn and Jake somewhat inspire her to be a better person. [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S04E12 <em>Gotcha!</em>]</p>
<p>In 999 AMB when LSP is about eighteen years old, a Lumpy Space person named Johnny, who was LSP's lab partner in high school, travels to the Land of Ooo to make a business deal with Princess Bubblegum over the trade of bottled gas. He happens to meet LSP in a bar and she ends up falling in love with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Princess Bubblegum has developed a "time travel" bubble which is capable of saving and loading the exact state of anything which is placed inside it. After LSP believes she has messed things up with Johnny she wants a do-over, so she tries to use the time machine to reset him back to "when he still loved her". But since Johnny has never been saved in the bubble, attempting to load a previous state simply deletes him from existence. Bubblegum then uses the time machine to remove LSP's memories of the whole ordeal. Johnny is lost forever, and LSP doesn't remember a thing. Nonetheless, for the early part of the relationship she acts uncharacteristically mature and seems to genuinely enjoy being with Johnny. [S05E49 <em>Bad Timing</em>]</p>

<p>Neptr (short for Never Ending Pie Throwing Robot) is a machine created by Finn to prank Jake. Neptr is brought to life after being struck by lightning, so Finn takes him to the Ice King to try to get more power. Neptr is left with two father figures: Finn, his creator, and Ice King, who imbued him with his own energy. However, he is ultimately neglected by both of them.

<p>Another of Finn's creations is the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant, a creature from an unknown past war who Finn wishes into existence when he reaches the centre of the Labyrinth and claims his wish from Aquandrius. APTWE is able to use his own wish to save Jake from death after he over-exerts himself to get through the Labyrinth. Like Neptr, Finn and Jake are neglectful of APTWE and appear to forget that he exists until they find him in their treasure room while clearing it out. Despite being wished into existence, APTWE appears to have some past connection to Darren the Ancient Sleeper, a villain who will appear later on. One account also states that he knew Billy in the past.

After conquering their fear of the outside world, the hyoomans stage an attack on the Candy Kingdom, but are repelled using fire.

<p>To celebrate Finn's thirteenth birthday, Jake organises a fake murder mystery on board a train. He fakes his own death and disguises himself as the conductor of the train, who is the "murderer". Finn fights the conductor using the Root Sword until Jake reveals that the whole thing was a set-up. Finn continues using the Root Sword as a replacement for Scarlet, which was lost when Finn dropped it into his black hole. [S03E19 <em>Mystery Train</em>, S02E15 <em>The Real You</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: "Root Sword" was a name invented by fans, but it was later canonised by <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em> and <em>Finn & Jake Investigations</em>.</p>
<p>Later that year, on Jake's birthday, Finn attempts to pull a similar stunt in revenge. He invites several people to a mansion (Princess Bubblegum, Cinnamon Bun, Lumpy Space Princess, BMO, Jake, and himself) to solve another fake murder case. However, Jake discovers his plan beforehand and decides to "flip the script" and trick Finn into thinking that the murders really were real by disguising Lady Rainicorn as a murderous ghost. Unbeknownst to either Finn or Jake, the mansion was once the hideout of the Bath Boy Gang. Due to the location's strong connection to Shoko, one of Finn's past lives, he sees real visions of her ghost. But due to all the layers of mistrust in the whole situation, Jake doesn't believe Finn when he tells him about the visions. Finn ends up storing the memory in his "vault".

Finn has a flashback to his past life as Shoko and learns that her unfinished business was the fact that she never returned the stolen amulet to Princess Bubblegum. Finn digs Shoko's corpse out from under the floorboards of the Tree Fort and gives the Blue Amulet back to Bubblegum, allowing Shoko to move on in peace and ending the nightmares.

<h3>The Lich Returns</h3>
<p>One day, Princess Bubblegum has a vision of the Lich while meditating. She takes Finn and Jake to see the amber prison where he is being held. While Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake are all protected from the Lich's telepathic powers, he is able to possess a snail that was riding on Finn's backpack. The snail cracks the amber enough for the Lich to seep out. He makes a mad dash for his Well of Power, with Finn and Jake in hot pursuit. Finn is armed with the Gauntlet of Billy and a sweater knitted for him by Bubblegum.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet. His only desire is to destroy life. If you fail, he'll kill everyone. Oh, there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. I just don't want you to get sick. Take this sweater. I made it myself.

<p>Meanwhile, Ice King kidnaps Princess Bubblegum and chases after the heroes to seek their permission to marry her. When they arrive at the Well of Power, Finn battles the Lich. The gauntlet is completely ineffective, but the sweater, imbued with what Finn calls "the power of liking someone a lot", is able to defeat him. All appears to be resolved until Ice King accidentally drops the princess into the well. [S02E24 <em>Mortal Folly</em>]</p>
<p>Princess Bubblegum is revived by her nurses and doctors, but Finn and Jake soon realise that she is possessed by the Lich. With Ice King's help they defeat the Lich for the second time, but almost kill Princess Bubblegum in the process. After reconstruction, there isn't enough candy biomass to restore Bubblegum to her usual physical age, so she technically becomes thirteen years old; the same age as Finn. The Lich, meanwhile, retreats to his snail form and begins to fabricate a new plan. [S02E25 <em>Mortal Recoil</em>]</p>
<p>By Candy Kingdom law, Princess Bubblegum is now too young to rule the kingdom. The next in line to the throne is none other than the psychopathic Earl of Lemongrab, who arrives at the castle to claim his leadership. Free of her responsibilities, Princess Bubblegum chooses to enjoy being a kid again. For the first time, she begins to reciprocate some of Finn's feelings for her, even sharing a kiss. However, the Earl unsurprisingly proves to be an awful ruler so Bubblegum uses donated candy biomass from her own citizens to re-age herself, and takes back the throne.

Ash is later arrested for fencing stolen property, impersonation, memory stealing, and "being a general pain in the butt".

<p>Later on, the most treasured possessions belonging to Finn, Jake, Bubblegum, and BMO are stolen by a door lord; a creature who is capable of conjuring magical doors. Their possessions are locked behind one such door, and the only way for them to retrieve them is to perform a song as a "genuine band". Along with Marceline, they eventually manage to open the door once Finn realises that the key is being truthful. It is revealed that the shirt Marceline gave to Bubblegum at the punk show is still her most treasured possession. It is also revealed that Marceline hadn't had anything stolen from her, and simply wanted to hang out with the others.

Jake witnesses this event and it puts him off eating Softy Cheese. Just like Warrior Princess, Clarence loses his mortal memories and is cursed to haunt the mortal plane as a ghost until he can discover how he died.</p>
<p>Ghost Princess and the ghost of Clarence end up falling in love a second time without remembering that they knew each other when they were alive. Finn and Jake successfully figure out that Clarence was Warrior Princess' accidental murderer by digging up both of their bodies and discovering the two halves of Clarence's knife. Jake also remembers seeing Clarence die in the Squeez-E-Mart. Having both discovered how they died, Ghost Princess and Clarence happily ascend to the Fiftieth Dead World together.

In the first message, Joshua tells them about the dungeon he built to store Kee-Oth's Demon Blood Sword, and challenges them to take it on.

<h3>Finn and Flame Princess</h3>
<p>Finn falls into a depression after realising that he has no chance with Princess Bubblegum. Jake tries to lift his spirits by finding him a new love interest his own age, and ends up travelling to the Fire Kingdom to try to convince Flame King to let Finn court his daughter; Flame Princess, the Fire Elemental. His mission is successful, but he discovers too late that Flame Princess is actually, according to her father, evil. So Jake tries to break off the relationship before it begins. All this does is make Flame Princess confused and angry. She chases Jake back to the Tree Fort and meets Finn for the first time, where she slaps him and then leaves. Even though this first meeting isn't exactly romantic, and even though Finn has no idea what's happening, it's love at first sight for him. [S03E26 <em>Incendium</em>]</p>
<p>Finn and Jake track down Flame Princess and discover that she is planning to turn the Goblin Kingdom into her own new fire kingdom. They build fire-proof suits with Neptr and confront the princess. After Finn has an emotional breakdown, Flame Princess sees his tears and believes him to be a water elemental; her natural opposite. This causes her to realise that Finn must really be in love with her.</p>

She knocks out Finn and Jake and gives them amnesia, and they wake up in a jail cell in the Nightosphere with no memory of where they are or how they got there. They wait in queue to see the Lord of Evil for twenty-seven days and eight hours and eventually escape the Nightosphere via a portal in Hunson Abadeer's castle.

<h3>Bubblegum's Malevolence</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich, I realised something: I'm not gonna live forever, Finn. I would if I could.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Princess Bubblegum [S04E10 <em>Goliad</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Princess Bubblegum decides to engineer a new replacement ruler for the Candy Kingdom, much like she did when creating the Earl of Lemongrab many years earlier. This new creation is a Candy Sphinx containing her own DNA who she names "Goliad". However, Goliad cannot learn how to be a good ruler, instead resorting to her mind control powers to keep the candy citizens in check. To prevent her from taking over the kingdom, Bubblegum creates a new sphinx, but this time she uses Finn's DNA instead of her own. Due to his heroic attributes, the new sphinx (named "Stormo") enters a psychic showdown with Goliad which ends in a stalemate. They remain locked in mental combat on the roof of Bubblegum's castle for many years to come. [S04E10 <em>Goliad</em>]</p>
<p>The fact that Finn's DNA caused Stormo to be good implies that Bubblegum's DNA was one of the things which caused Goliad to go bad. As previously discussed, Bubblegum had a malevolent past while ruling the early Candy Kingdom. The casual way in which she tampers with the life she creates hints at the paranoid need for control she previously expressed all the way back at the foundation of the kingdom; an attitude which is mirrored and taken to the extreme by Goliad. [S04E10 <em>Goliad</em>, S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum also demonstrates her need for control after Cookie takes several of her citizens hostage inside a convenience store and demands her crown. Bubblegum wants to have Cookie permanently locked up in the dungeon for this crime, but Jake comes to see Cookie's point of view and tries to help him escape. The escape is unsuccessful, but Cookie ends up going to a mental hospital rather than the dungeon.</p>

<p>Finn and Jake learn about her surveillance network later that year after two banana guards show it to them. It is also revealed that Bubblegum has implanted a GPS tracker in Finn's ear so she can monitor him as well, and she has implemented extensive surveillance beyond the jurisdiction of her own kingdom. [S04E20 <em>You Made Me</em>, S04E19 <em>Lady & Peebles</em>, S06E22 <em>The Cooler</em>]</p>
<p>Despite claiming undifferentiated love for all her subjects, this love appears to be superficial as Bubblegum shows little respect towards their individual freedoms, treating them as playthings rather than as people. After Finn and Jake discover her cloning machine, it is revealed that she routinely clones her subjects whenever they get lost or "die", often at the expense of the original. [<em>Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!!</em>, S05E42 <em>James</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<p>Her stubborn nature and her rejection of the concept of magic also put her at odds with the magical community of Wizard City. She serves jail time in wizard prison for entering the city as a none magic user and arguing with the Grand Master Wizard, but she manages to break out. This event is presumably detrimental to her diplomatic relationship with the city. [S05E26 <em>Wizards Only, Fools</em>]</p>

Eventually, they discover that the Mother Gum, who has been locked up for centuries, has seeped into the structure of the dungeon and weakened the doors, allowing the prisoners to escape. The explorers find themselves forced to fight the Mother Gum, and after the battle it is unable to remain bound as one entity. The Mother Gum disperses into hundreds of pieces.

<p>By the end of Magic Man's banishment, he still hasn't managed to activate his Martian transporter because he still has no friends who he cares about, and he falsely believes that it's broken. Grob Gob Glob Grod returns to Earth to retrieve Magic Man for his trial. However, Magic Man switches bodies with Jake. Glob takes Jake back to Mars instead of Magic Man, and Finn uses the transporter to follow them in an attempt to rescue his friend.

Finn and Jake only realise the Lich's true identity after the Gumball Guardians attack him and burn off some of Billy's skin, but by this point it is too late. The Lich inserts the gems into the front cover of the Enchiridion and opens a portal to the Time Room. Finn and Jake manage to follow him through. [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
<p>The three of them all arrive in the Time Room, and as a result they are each granted one wish by the almighty Cosmic Entity Prismo. The Lich wishes for the destruction of all life, and he is transported to his own wish-altered reality where that wish has come true.

Unfortunately he is crushed to death under the weight of the frozen bomb, and Evergreen's crown grieves its fallen master by plunging the world into an apocalyptic ice age. The Blue Catalyst Comet misses the Earth and never delivers its Agent of Change.

However, Big Destiny, leader of Destiny Gang, refuses to allow the debt to be paid off and instead burns down Junk Town and the Mertens household.

<p>Meanwhile, Prismo, Jake, and the Cosmic Owl are left alone in the Time Room. Jake initially loses focus and almost wastes his wish to create a sandwich, but once he has befriended the Cosmic Entities, Prismo begins to guide him towards the wish that will save the Multiverse.</p>

He also begins to become tired of his growing fame in the Candy Kingdom, causing him to disguise himself as Davey for a while; his unremarkable alter ego and past life. [S05E05 <em>All the Little People</em>, S05E07 <em>Davey</em>, <em>Adventure Time #50</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his relationship with Flame Princess is ongoing. Finn takes her through a dungeon and uses it to convince her that she isn't evil, despite her father's intentions to the contrary. However, the dungeon also begins to reveal that Finn and Flame Princess share different interests, and Finn begins to get hung up on a lot of what Jake calls "imaginary problems" in their relationship. It is at this time Finn travels into "Pillow World", a possibly imaginary alternate timeline, and returns with no memory of what happened while he was there.

<h3>Alternate timeline: Pillow World</h3>
<p>Finn arrives alone in Pillow World and becomes hero of a town after slaying a blanket dragon. Since the exit back to the real world seals itself behind him, he is trapped in Pillow World. Seeing no way out, he settles down and begins leading a new life there. He falls in love with Roselinen, the daughter of the town's mayor Quilton.</p>
<p>Finn and Roselinen marry and have two children named Jay and Bonnie, named after Jake and Princess Bubblegum. Quilton visits their home and tells Finn that he has discovered evidence of a doorway leading back to the real world. Finn begins to dedicate his life to finding the door.</p>

<p>By now an elderly man, Finn visits Rasheeta the Oracle in his continuing quest to find the door back to his own world. She merely tells him that there is "not long now" until he will be able to return home.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Oh Finn. I know you have to go. All these years, I've known. But now that it's time... Oh man, well I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us when you're back in your real life.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Roselinen [S05E16 <em>Puhoy</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Finn decides to remain with his new family, since he's known them for longer by this point than anyone back in the real world. After a lifetime spent in Pillow World, Finn dies of old age. He narrowly avoids falling into the maw of GOLB and emerges from the pillow fort back in the real world, restored to his young body. Despite Roselinen's wish, he immediately forgets everything about his life in Pillow World and continues as if nothing ever happened.</p>

<p>A fortune teller informs Flame Princess that she is going to suffer a loss in the future, referring to the fact that she was planning on stealing Finn's soul. However, the fortune turns out to have further implications for their relationship later on. [<em>Playing With Fire</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Finn seems to harbour a slight feeling of bitterness towards Princess Bubblegum for the way their relationship panned out, but he never entirely loses interest. He expresses slight jealousy after learning that Braco is "courting" the princess, even though he himself is dating Flame Princess at this time.</p>

<p>Eventually it all unravels. After witnessing two battles between Flame Princess and Ice King, he begins to have a certain type of dream about her. The Cosmic Owl is present, meaning they are prophetic dreams, and Jake convinces Finn that he needs to force himself to have the dream again so that he can hear the full prophecy. Finn forges letters from Ice King to Flame Princess and vice versa, in which they challenge each other to a final fight. During the resultant battle, the Ice Kingdom is almost completely destroyed by Flame Princess' attacks and its residents are forced to evacuate. Thankfully, the underground structures of the kingdom like the "The Past" room and the secret library are left intact. Finn faints from the heat during the battle and completes the prophetic dream, but the prophecy is only three words long.</p>

<h3>A Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Following her breakup with Finn, Flame Princess begins to develop serious trust issues. She volunteers to take part in Princess Bubblegum's research into her "elemental matrix" because she believes it will be able to cure her complex emotions, but the test is interrupted when Bubblegum has to go and help Finn and Jake deal with Gunter, who has used the Crown to rebel against Ice King. Bubblegum leaves her goofy "half baked" assistant Cinnamon Bun to oversee the rest of the test. Cinnamon Bun releases Flame Princess from the test chamber, and she is charmed by the simplicity and honesty of his life. Cinnamon Bun tells her about how it was Princess Bubblegum who had her locked up as a child, further compounding her trust issues. Finally, Flame Princess and Cinnamon Bun stage a coup in the Fire Kingdom and she takes the throne from her father. She installs a policy of absolute honesty for all citizens of the kingdom so that nobody is legally allowed to lie. [S05E32 <em>Earth & Water</em>]</p>
<p>Flame Princess takes the title of King and has her father locked up in the same lantern as she was imprisoned in for the first fifteen years of her life. This event fulfils the prophecy that Flame King's daughter would become more powerful than him. [S05E32 <em>Earth & Water</em>]</p>
<p>Finn is also feeling lost after the end of his first real romantic relationship, falling into a bit of a depression.</p>

<p>He takes refuge in the relative simplicity of places like the Dungeon Train and the Box Kingdom. He briefly crushes on Princess Bubblegum again but quickly realises that she is too mature for him, especially after learning that she is actually hundreds of years old, rather than nineteen as she has been telling him. For a while he decides to entirely devote himself to her as a loyal servant, but that doesn't work out either.

<p>While he is in this funk he also gets a poorly timed marriage proposal from Slime Princess, who needs a named husband in order to remain a legitimate heir to the throne to prevent her evil sister Blagertha from militarising the Slime Kingdom. It is unclear whether or not Finn and Slime Princess actually remain married after Blagertha's plans for conquest are foiled. [S05E35 <em>Love Games</em>]</p>
<p>After Flame Princess has been ruling for some time, her father secretly organises a deal with his old friend Don John the Flame Lord, who agrees to help him escape the lantern if he grants him his daughter's hand in marriage. Don John arranges for Flame Princess to be poisoned by her servant Ursula, and succeeds in returning the Red Throne to Flame King while she is weakened by hypnotising the Flame King's guards and court. Flame Princess chooses to go to Finn for help on strictly platonic terms.</p>

<p>Predictably, Finn lets his residual feelings for Flame Princess interfere with the mission to retake the kingdom. They end up getting captured by Don John and Flame King. However, a fight breaks out between them and Flame King knocks out Don John. In the resulting confusion and the lifting of the hypnosis spell, Cinnamon Bun is able to rescue Finn and Flame Princess. During the rescue he takes a blast of fire to the face, causing him to become "fully baked" and gain a great deal of maturity. After imprisoning Flame King and Don John and re-installing Flame Princess on the throne, Cinnamon Bun pledges his allegiance to Flame Princess and becomes her champion.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Flame Princess may not be the most ruthless of all despots, but she is strong where it really counts; in her heart. And that is good.

<p>Princess Bubblegum resolves the conflict between the Sea Caves, the Mountain Pass, and the Spirit Hollow at around this time, and also sends Finn and Jake to solve a leadership crisis in the Nameless Kingdom. They resolve it by choosing Nightmare Princess to rule rather than either of her two sisters. [<em>Bitter Sweets</em>, <em>Secret of the Nameless Kingdom</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: <em>Finn & Jake Investigations</em> confirms that the Nightmare Princess ending is the canon ending to <em>Secret of the Nameless Kingdom</em>. The final form of Nightmare Princess in <em>SotNK</em> looks very similar to Nightmare Princess from the episode <em>Orb</em>. This appears to be the show acknowledging the existence of the Nameless Kingdom, but might also suggest that the game is non-canon since Finn does not recognise the princess when they meet in <em>Orb</em>.</p>

<p>After getting tired of Ice King crashing in the Tree Fort, Finn and Jake invite Abracadaniel to stay so that he can befriend Ice King and hopefully get him out of their hair. The plan works, but backfires horribly when Ice King accidentally summons the demon Kee-Oth while showing off the Demon Blood Sword to his new friend. Kee-Oth forces Finn and Jake to return his blood, destroying the Demon Blood Sword, and then kidnaps Jake under the false belief that he is Joshua. [S05E40 <em>Play Date</em>]</p>

He is also put off by Jake's passive attitude towards the whole situation, claiming that his father would have put up a better fight. Nevertheless he continues to keep Jake prisoner and forces him to fight with another prisoner named Samantha.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Earth, Finn calls Lady, who is able to find some old tapes of Joshua detailing the ritual for travelling to the Broke-Up Dimension where Kee-Oth resides. They travel to Cave 73H of the Underground Grasslands Complex and recover a magical tablet which they are able to use to transport them there. Finn brings a fake demon blood sword made of frozen grape juice (blessed by Shelby to give it the properties of holy water) and tricks Kee-Oth into absorbing it. Kee-Oth is killed by the holy grape juice and Finn, Jake, Lady, and Samantha all return to Earth. [S05E41 <em>The Pit</em>]</p>

<h3>The Chronicles of James</h3>
<p>Over the course of the past few years, the technological level and affluence of the Candy Kingdom has been slowly rising. Modern mechanical vehicles like cars, underground trains, aeroplanes, and helicopters have seen a considerable rise in popularity, and the Candy Kingdom has developed a bustling down-town area complete with offices and a theatre district. The decorpsinator serum is developed following the two zombie invasions, and the Spoon of Prosperity (an item with magical healing powers) is recovered from an ancient city which was turned to sand by an evil wizard named Paris. Both of these make the candy people a very secure and prolific species.

She leads a small expedition into the desert to collect samples, saying she wants to begin colonising the area by the end of the year. Accompanying her on the expedition are Finn and Jake, as well as a candy person named James. Their vehicle ends up getting disabled by some of the oozers which still inhabit the remains of the old city. James sacrifices himself so that the others can escape and gets turned into an oozer, but Princess Bubblegum is able to use a piece of his flesh to clone a new version of him once they get back to the Candy Kingdom. He is awarded a medal for bravery. [S05E42 <em>James</em>]</p>
<p>Later on, the new James fakes his own death by performing "selfless acts" twenty four times in order to keep getting awarded medals and keep getting cloned, saying he likes his own company. His scheme is eventually foiled by Princess Bubblegum. However, the original James, who became an oozer, happens to attack the Candy Kingdom at this time along with a load of other oozers. Wanting to prove that they really are heroes, all twenty five James clones leap onto the oozer and become amalgamated into one new entity. Bubblegum banishes them into the wasteland where they live in a tent. [S06E03 <em>James II</em>, S09E10 <em>Abstract</em>]</p>

One day she recruits Finn and Jake to try to work out who was stealing her apples, which leads them on a wild goose chase through the back streets of the Candy Kingdom until they are captured by a gang of criminals. Finn and Jake eventually realise that "apples" is slang for "diamonds" and their entire escapade has been pointless. However, they rescue a pig (named Mr. Pig) from the gang while they are escaping, and later discover that Tree Trunks' apples were actually being stolen by birds due to the fact that Raggedy Princess was no longer acting as her scarecrow.

Bubblegum desperately attempts to find something she can arrest him for by snooping around in his airship while he is officiating the wedding, even though had she attended the ceremony she would have discovered that the entire event was merely a front for getting Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig to sign up to work in his labour camp.</p>

<p>All is well for a while longer, until an argument breaks out between the Lemongrabs over their "son", a porcelain doll named Lemon Sweets, who is accidentally shattered during the disagreement. The original bites off half of his clone's face, and the symmetry of their rule begins to break down. Lemongrab Number One grows fat and ever more powerful while Lemongrab Number Two becomes thin and decrepit, unable to counteract the increasingly tyrannical rule of his brother. [S05E24 <em>Another Five More Short Graybles</em>, S05E32 <em>Too Old</em>]</p>
<p>During a diplomatic mission to the earldom, Princess Bubblegum and Finn discover a boy named Lemonhope who is unlike the other lemon people. He appears sweet and kind and he plays the harp. She states her intention to take Lemonhope back to the Candy Kingdom to give him a proper education, but Fat Lemongrab forbids it. Lemongrab Number Two takes some pity on the child and tries to help him escape. This pushes Fat Lemongrab over the scales, and he consumes his twin brother whole.</p>

</div>
<p>With help from the rebellious lemon citizens, Lemonhope returns to the Candy Kingdom with Princess Bubblegum. The rebellion of his people and the betrayal of his brother cause Fat Lemongrab to reduce his earldom to a totalitarian dictatorship where those who helped with the escape are punished, and those who try to escape for themselves are cannibalised. Lemongrab Number Two remains alive in his brother's stomach, begging for Lemonhope's heroic return. However, back in the Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope is reluctant to become the hero everyone expects him to be. Instead, he develops the same selfish attitude as his progenitors, eventually causing him to run away from the kingdom on a quest for true freedom.</p>

<p>After wandering the Land of Ooo for a while, Lemonhope stumbles across a town being raided by pirates and chooses to stow away on their ship. But the ship is attacked and abducted by a greed lard; all of the crew go missing in the battle, and the greed lard drops the ship in the middle of a desert. Lemonhope lives a lonesome life for a while, barely surviving on the short supply of rations left in the ship. He has frequent nightmares about his people back in the earldom. Soon, he collapses from the heat of the desert while out searching for water. [S05E50 <em>Lemonhope Part One</em>]</p>
<p>Lemonhope is rescued by a mysterious individual who calls himself "Phlannel Boxingday"; almost certainly Princess Bubblegum in disguise. Phlannel's profession is hunting greed lards from his cloud ship. After nursing Lemonhope back to health he offers to take him on as his apprentice. Lemonhope agrees and seems to enjoy his life on the cloud ship, but the nightmares about his people continue. Phlannel manages to convince him that the best way to make them stop would probably be to fulfil his responsibility to the people of the earldom.</p>

</div>
<p>Lemonhope decides that he will make it his mission to defeat Fat Lemongrab, but only to make the nightmares stop rather than in duty to his people. He arrives at the earldom, and with help from the lemon citizens he is able to use his harp to cause Fat Lemongrab to explode. Both Lemongrabs are ripped apart in the blast, and the earldom is liberated from Fat Lemongrab's tyranny. [S05E51 <em>Lemonhope Part Two</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum sews the remains of the two Lemongrabs into one new Lemongrab, recognising that being alone is his only stable relationship model, and puts him back in charge of the earldom, hoping that he will do better this time. Lemonhope, now truly free, chooses to leave the Candy Kingdom and explore the world, declining Bubblegum's assumption that he would want to stay with his people.</p>

<h3>Martin's Escape, and the Death of Prismo</h3>
<p>Finn meets Billy's ex-girlfriend Canyon, and together they decide to complete Billy's bucket list to honour the death of the great hero. The final item on the list, however, is Finn's single greatest nightmare; he must overcome his paralysing fear of the ocean, perpetuated by the parasitic Fear Feaster which still lives inside him. Finn is determined to honour Billy, so he falls off the end of a pier. The Fear Feaster emerges to torment Finn, but Finn finds that he has drawn the Grass Sword; or rather, the Grass Sword has drawn itself. Despite the Fear Feaster claiming that no "mortal weapon" can harm him, Finn slays the parasite and suddenly finds that his fear is gone. Having completed the list, Finn experiences a vision of Billy, who tells him that his real human father, Martin Mertens, is still locked up in the Citadel. [S05E52 <em>Billy's Bucket List</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jake has been spending more and more of his time partying in the Time Room, having made friends with the almighty Prismo. The Lich is also still trapped in the Time Room.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">Those guys are doing selfies on the Lich. Is that safe?</p>
  <p>Oh yeah, it's fine. He's harmless.</p>
  <p class="alt">Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone in the room right now? Controlling our minds, making us rip each other's eyes out while we buttercup one another?</p>
  <p>Well, the Lich's primary function is to cause mass death. And since he can't do that while he's trapped in my Time Room, he's stuck in a standstill, like a machine without a purpose.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Peppermint Butler and Prismo [S06E01 <em>Wake Up</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>After Jake hears about Finn's father being trapped in the Citadel, he suggests going to Prismo for advice. Prismo tells them that the only way to get to the Citadel is to commit a cosmic crime. One such crime would be to murder a wish master such as himself. He tells them that they can temporarily "kill" him by waking up the mysterious old man who dreams of his existence.</p>
<div class="quote">

</div>
<p>Finn and Jake retrieve the old man and bring him back to the Time Room so that Prismo can see himself one last time. However, the Lich, who has overheard their whole conversation, leaps up and disintegrates the old man, apparently ending Prismo's existence for good. The Guardians of the Citadel show up to arrest him and Finn and Jake follow the Lich through the portal to the Citadel. [S06E01 <em>Wake Up</em>]</p>
<p>Once in the Citadel, the Lich begins to melt the crystal keeping him and the other prisoners in place, and a mass breakout of all the worst criminals in the Multiverse begins. One of the escapees is Martin Mertens; Finn's father. However, rather than the happy family reunion Finn had been expecting, Martin shows no signs of even recognising Finn or caring that he's his son. His leg is blasted off by one of the Guardians and he is forced to take Finn's help. Finn retrieves some of the Guardian blood, which has healing properties, and uses it to regrow Martin's leg. But Martin still shows no gratitude and attempts to abandon Finn and escape with the other prisoners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lich escapes his own crystal and begins controlling the prisoners' minds to build an army. He confronts Finn.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Fall. You are alone, child. There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people. These ancients are just the beginning. I will command a great and terrible army, and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the End.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Lich [S06E02 <em>Escape from the Citadel</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>But just as he is about to strike Finn down, Finn throws some of the leftover Guardian blood into his chest cavity. Convulsing violently, a new body grows around the Lich and transforms him from a skeletal monster to a massive baby-like creature. The evil within him is washed away and he takes on the personality of an innocent child.</p>
<p>Finn grabs Martin's spaceship in an attempt to prevent him and the other prisoners from escaping. The Grass Sword expands and grows around his entire arm to enforce his grip. However, this is not enough. The spaceship pulls away into the void and Finn's entire arm is ripped off, leaving nothing but a stump with a small flower growing out of it. The amputated Finn escapes through a portal back to the Land of Ooo along with Jake and the babified Lich.</p>
<p>Finn and Jake leave the Lich on the doorstep of the recently married Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, who decide to raise the child as their own under the name "Sweet Pig-Trunks", or Sweet P for short. [S06E02 <em>Escape from the Citadel</em>]</p>

<p>Finn begins to obsess about getting revenge on his father for causing him to lose his arm. Somehow, he manifests what Princess Bubblegum calls a "telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis"; a magic arm. Finn uses the arm to build an enormous tower into the upper atmosphere. He meets a cloud person named Carol during his journey into the sky. Meanwhile, on the ground, Jake and Bubblegum argue about whether they should let him work things out on his own or whether they should intervene to prevent him from hurting himself. At the edge of space, Finn appears to get abducted, and wakes up in a spaceship where he finds Martin. However, after attempting to tear off his arm, Finn realises that enacting revenge isn't as cathartic as he had been expecting. At that point, Princess Bubblegum reveals that the whole thing was staged. Martin was actually merely a costume, and the "spaceship" is actually the Candy Kingdom's fallout shelter, where Bubblegum took him after he fell unconscious. The magical arm de-manifests and Finn feels slightly better about the whole situation with his father. [S06E04 <em>The Tower</em>]</p>

<p>Finn descends into another period of depression. He tries to make out with as many princesses as possible (including Lumpy Space Princess) in an attempt to cheer his mood and save the wilting flower that grows from his stump, but none of it really helps. Eventually he meets a virgin queen bee named Breezy, who falls in love with Finn's flower and becomes a true queen to save Finn from a group of thugs. Somehow, this allows Finn to grow a brand new fully developed arm. Breezy keeps the flower. [S06E06 <em>Breezy</em>]</p>

<p>As previously discussed, his most notable friend during this time is Abracadaniel, who, despite their past rivalry during Wizard Battle, he befriends after they stay together at the Tree Fort. In addition, Ice King accidentally frees the Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving from his dungeon in an attempt to get him to bring Fionna and Cake into the real world, which fails of course. ASMoLG accidentally brings Finn's hat to life with an evil spirit. The hat attacks the Candy Kingdom and manages to possess one of the Gumball Guardians, but after learning how to properly control his powers ASMoLG is able to turn him good. The hat becomes known as Little Dude, and he and his creator at some point befriend the Ice King.

Abracadaniel hires a bus and departs along with Ice King, ASMoLG, Little Dude, a Wizard City shopkeeper named Ron James, a goblin wizard named Beau, a stranger named Giuseppe, and the water nymphs who live in the pond by the Tree Fort. Giuseppe is lost after stepping off the bus to collect some crabapples, and the water nymphs bail on the trip after the bus gets stuck in a swamp. But the mysterious Giuseppe returns and uses telekinetic powers to lift the bus out of the swamp before disappearing. The road trip cements the wizards' friendship and they form their own secret society named the Order of Giuseppe, with the crabapple tree as their symbol. Probably for the first time since putting on the crown, Ice King has a real group of friends. [S06E13 <em>Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!</em>, <em>Ice King #3</em>]</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the crown, Ice King falls out with the other members frequently and isn't a particularly good friend to them.

<p>Princess Bubblegum decides to set up a fake kidnapping case to test the investigative capabilities of the Banana Guard. Finn and Jake pretend to steal her away and throw her into Lake Butterscotch wrapped in a carpet, leaving clues for the banana guards along the way. However, it is instead Root Beer Guy who ends up solving the case. As a result, Root Beer Guy is made captain of the Banana Guard and is able to quit his job at the call centre. He replaces the former captain, whose failures included letting Jake's gang get away with the Bakers' Shard. Root Beer Guy also stops writing his detective novel, since he's now living the life of a real detective, much to the relief of his long-suffering wife Cherry Cream Soda.

<h3>Alternate timeline: Banana Guard Academy</h3>
<p>Before Maja's attack, a new timeline is created when Princess Bubblegum decides to open the Banana Guard to non-bananas. Commandant Banana Guard, the former captain, is envious of Root Beer Guy for taking his job and plots to sabotage him by deliberately failing all of the new recruits. In response, the recruits make plans to have the Commandant fired and replaced. The original candidate for his replacement is Lemongrab, but after he is killed by Lemonhope, Bubblegum offers the job to Root Beer Guy in addition to his captaincy. However, he is also killed during Maja's attack. After Peppermint Butler consults an oracle to ask whether or not they should have Commandant Banana Guard replaced, the timeline fractures into two further alternate realities; one where the Commandant is fired, and one where he keeps his position. Peppermint Butler is able to repair the Multiverse after talking to the ghost of Root Beer Guy, but the reunified timeline inadvertently leads to a robot apocalypse for some reason. [<em>Banana Guard Academy #1</em> to <em>#5</em>]</p>
<p>Five years later, in 1004 AMB, Peppermint Butler and the small group of remaining rebels journey to the Citadel of Temporal Attunement, where he is able to travel back in time and undo the apocalypse by preventing Princess Bubblegum from opening the Banana Guard to non-bananas. This erases the entire timeline, leaving Peppermint Butler as the only one able to remember it. He apparently makes no attempt to prevent the defeat of Lemongrab or the death of Root Beer Guy the second time around, preferring to let destiny run its course.

The duplicate of Jake falls asleep in the Time Room and transforms back into the old man who was killed by the Lich. The duplicate of Finn gets transformed into a sword by some kind of paradox.

So in an effort to dispel this fear she contracts Banana Guard 16, who has secretly been doing graffiti on the streets of the kingdom, to paint a mural in the castle's banquet hall.

<h3>Seven and the Huge King</h3>
<p>When Marceline holds a yard sale to sell off some of the late Billy's old artifacts, Wildberry Princess buys an artifact called the Feed Bucket of Plenty. This artifact regenerates the Wildberry Kingdom's livestock to improve the productivity of their lucrative meat industry. However, the regenerated meat has extreme side effects; the wildberry people who eat it become servile fruit-meat hybrids known as "food boys". Since there is no way to turn them back, Wildberry Princess donates them to the Huge King, who lives in an underground cavern and is looking for servants to keep him fed. She gives the Feed Bucket of Plenty back to Marceline, who locks it back up in Billy's cave along with all the other dangerous artifacts she sold.

<p>Finn and Jake's brother Jermaine has been guarding their old family home ever since the death of Joshua and Margaret. The demons who want their possessions back have grown no less rowdy in all this time and are kept outside by a salt barrier. Jermaine keeps one of them, named Bryce, locked up in his basement. But the spell used to keep the demon in place must be refreshed regularly by flipping a cassette tape, meaning Jermaine is just as trapped as his captive.</p>
<p>After Jake reaches Jermaine via his dreams he resolves to go and visit his brother in the real world. He and Finn arrive at the old house and immediately begin messing around with the artifacts that Jermaine spends his life protecting. Jake even breaks the salt barrier to get some salt to make fried rice, letting a demon into the house. Eventually Jake and Jermaine get into a fight and accidentally start a fire. But rather than attempting to save the house, Jermaine decides he's had enough.</p>

<p>Finally free from having to spend his days flipping a cassette tape, Jermaine becomes a painter. He initially focusses on strictly representational landscape art, but later he gets into abstractionism. He ends up forming a professional relationship with Bryce, his former captive, who becomes his art dealer. [S09E01 <em>Orb</em>, S09E10 <em>Abstract</em>]</p>

<h3>The Election and the Purple Catalyst Comet</h3>
<p>Since Tree Trunks' wedding, the self-proclaimed King of Ooo has apparently managed to go broke. It's possible his assets were seized after he escaped prison, but it feels more likely that he just spent all his money irresponsibly. So he and Toronto begin to enact his next big plan. Part of that is to exploit Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig's newly adopted son, the former Lich now known as Sweet P.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback. This kid is great at helping us rob people.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">King of Ooo [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>However, this exploitation uncovers Sweet P's hidden dark side and his Lich half is able to scare away the thieves. But again, this would not be the last the Candy Kingdom would see of the King of Ooo. Later on, Sweet P begins to have dreams about the approaching Purple Catalyst Comet. [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>, S06E39 <em>Be Sweet</em>]</p>
<p>Gunter, the penguin form of Orgalorg, still harbours some deep recognition of his true identity. Masquerading as a female bird, he meets the Cosmic Owl during a dream. The Cosmic Owl falls in love with the dream version of Gunter, and Gunter is able to manipulate him into granting him access to Princess Bubblegum's dream. He interferes and causes the dream to go bad, depicting rebellion against Princess Bubblegum and the fall of the kingdom. And since the Cosmic Owl is present, the events of the dream become inevitable. Gunter does not seem entirely aware of the consequences of his actions, but the shadow of Orgalorg buried deep within him has a plan. [S06E36 <em>Hoots</em>]</p>
<p>A few days later, the penguins of the Ice Kingdom all hold a party in the Ice King's lair. While rescuing Lumpy Space Princess from a walrus, Gunter cracks his head open. This catalyses some kind of change within Gunter's mind. For a brief time, Orgalorg takes over. He constructs a ritual to inform his subjects that he has returned, but halfway through Gunter fights back into his own mind and puts a stop to it. But the damage is done, as Orgalorg begins clawing his way back towards consciousness. Like Sweet P, he begins having visions of the impending comet. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<p>Princess Bubblegum also foresees the Purple Comet; not through a dream or through a vision, but through a telescope. She understands the destruction it could potentially bring and decides to continue with her space program. Since her previous spacecraft was stolen by the leaflan during her mission to rescue Marceline, she designs a new one. Her plan is presumably to redirect the comet should it end up on a collision course with her kingdom. [<em>Marceline Gone Adrift #6</em>, S06E42 <em>Hot Diggity Doom</em>]</p>
<p>Orgalorg meets the King of Ooo at some point. The King of Ooo is planning to run an election against Princess Bubblegum to have himself voted in as the new princess. The election is apparently "barely yet fully legal" despite the fact that the Candy Kingdom has traditionally been an autocracy ruled by nobody other than Princess Bubblegum, with very few exceptions. Believing that this will help bring about the fall of the kingdom as depicted in Bubblegum's dream, Orgalorg decides to help the King of Ooo and becomes his campaign manager under the guise of "Mr. X", a mysterious cloaked individual. Together, Orgalorg, Toronto, and the Veritas Brigade (Starchy's secret society) campaign for the King of Ooo's election to the gullible and easily swayed candy people. Princess Bubblegum, believing that there is no way she would ever lose given the electorate is comprised of her own creations, does not campaign, and instead spends her time continuing to study the Purple Comet. [S06E42 <em>Hot Diggity Doom</em>, S08E17 <em>High Strangeness</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I'm studying something that could be real important. This dumb election. It's not even... I mean, it's barely even legal. And even being legal; I made everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds. They know that I love them.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Princess Bubblegum [S06E42 <em>Hot Diggity Doom</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>However, Bubblegum is wrong. Following the election, the results are announced by Starchy, leader of the Veritas Brigade, who reveals that the winner is in fact King of Ooo. Horrified and upset with her people, Bubblegum and the ever-loyal Peppermint Butler move out of the castle and begin living at Gumbald's old shack on the shore of Lake Butterscotch. She tells Finn and Jake to remain behind and keep an eye on her former subjects, knowing that something big is coming.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Your allegiance is to the kingdom. Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge... <em>if</em> I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. Auf wiedersehen, meine champions.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Bubblegum [S06E42 <em>Hot Diggity Doom</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>A mere few hours after the King of Ooo's inauguration, the sky begins to turn purple and the people of the Candy Kingdom begin to panic. With Bubblegum exiled and the kingdom's forces preoccupied, Orgalorg finishes making Bubblegum's spaceship flight-worthy and hijacks it. Just before take-off, Finn and Jake discover him in the vehicle assembly building and manage to get on board the spacecraft and don spacesuits before they leave the atmosphere. Once in orbit they encounter Orgalorg, who, finally free of the Earth's imprisoning gravity, is able to take his true form and reveal his plan. [S06E42 <em>Hot Diggity Doom</em>, S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Glob K.O.-ing himself, the arrival of the Catalyst Comet, and a ship to carry me out of this planet's gravity. These are doorways the universe presented to me. It's all yours if you're willing to take it.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Orgalorg [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Orgalorg intends to absorb the power and knowledge of the Catalyst Comet, just as he attempted thousands of years ago when he was first defeated by Glob and banished to Earth. He perceives his stowaways as little more than a minor nuisance, and throws them out into space where Finn and Jake drift apart and lose each other. With no other options, Finn can do nothing but make what he calls an "appeal to higher forces". And yet somehow, this is enough. From nowhere, Martin appears, riding a moth which he had stolen from the koala people. Despite their history, Finn is relieved to see his father again. The moth flies them both back towards Orgalorg, who has begun to digest the comet. Seeing his opportunity, Finn leaps into Orgalorg's mouth in a last ditch effort to stop him. Finn's Grass Sword, which has been trapped inside his new arm ever since he received it, emerges and whips around inside Orgalorg's stomach, tearing him apart from the inside and freeing the Purple Catalyst Comet. It breaks open, and the consciousness of the comet converses with Finn and Martin and offers Finn a new mode of existence. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>, S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>, S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I give you a choice: come with me to the end and the beginning, or struggle here a while like a beautiful autumn leaf. This is your crisis.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Purple Catalyst Comet [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Finn declines the offer, but Martin decides that leaving the physical plane sounds like a pretty neat deal. Martin and the Comet discorporate, leaving Finn alone and drifting in space once again. But the higher forces still have one trick up their sleeve. Jake's prophetic dream from three years prior, which he believed was a vision of his own death, comes true. Bubblegum had not been the only one planning to travel into space to see the Comet; Banana Man had also been developing his own spacecraft. Banana Man comes across Jake drifting on his own through the darkness, and after being rescued they manage to find Finn as well. The remains of Orgalorg manage to grab onto the spacecraft as it is de-orbiting, and he becomes compressed during re-entry back into his usual harmless penguin form. Finn, Jake, Banana Man, and Gunter all splash down in Butterscotch Lake, and the Land of Ooo is safe once more. [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
<p>While the King of Ooo's failure to deal with the comet and the kingdom's other problems lose him some trust amongst his new subjects, he remains in power for now. [S07E01 <em>Bonnie and Neddy</em>]</p>

<h3>The Former Princess Bubblegum</h3>
<p>Bubblegum and Peppermint Butler are leading a simple life away from the Candy Kingdom, keeping themselves busy by repairing Gumbald's dilapidated shack. However, Bubblegum finds herself having to intervene in royal affairs after Finn, Jake, Toronto, and the King of Ooo discover her dragon brother Neddy under the Great Tree during a treasure census. Neddy, terrified by the unexpected strangers who have invaded his space, runs away from the kingdom. The juice produced by Neddy is the lifeblood of the kingdom, powering its plumbing and electricity generation, and acting as a defensive moat. After its production ceases, the King of Ooo recognises that the kingdom's collapse is imminent and plans to charge a high price for the remainder of the juice so that he can still make a profit out of the deteriorating situation. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, go to Bubblegum for help. She is able to track down her brother and returns him to his chamber under the tree where he is able to continue producing the juice. She gives the banana guards outside his chamber secret permission to prevent the King of Ooo from ever entering again, and the kingdom is safe once more.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">Hey Bonnie... You always act like a loner, right? But next to your brother you're the light of the party.</p>
  <p>I mean yeah. One of the first things I did after making sure Neddy was safe was to start making the candy people. I was formed in the Mother Gum. My mind and my gum were in touch with dozens of others, like a crowded womb. I guess I missed that... People get built different. We don't need to figure it out, we just need to respect it. Maybe Neddy likes his own company better than I like mine.</p>

<p>Marceline doesn't learn about the election until Bubblegum has already been off the throne for two months. The fact that Bubblegum no longer has a kingdom to worry about gives them a unique opportunity to reconnect. Although their friendship has been slowly repairing for the past few years, this is the first time Bubblegum truly opens up to Marceline about the problems she is facing.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I lost my hat, lost my home, lost my people. I can't even keep darn varmints out of my pumpkin patch. I tried. I really really tried.

<p>Conversely, Marceline also begins to have some much deeper discussions with Bubblegum about her own concerns; most notably, she is unsure if she wants to remain immortal. Bubblegum begins researching methods to "cure" Marceline's vampirism. [S07E06 <em>Marceline the Vampire Queen</em>]</p>

  <p>Well... The machine is built and the serums are ready, but... are you sure you wanna do this?</p>
  <p class="alt">I'm sure. Some bad things happened to me when I was little. When I became a vampire, I was just a messed up kid. Now it's a thousand years later and I'm still messed up. I don't wanna spend eternity like this. With this emptiness. I wanna grow up.</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline and Bubblegum [S07E06 <em>Marceline the Vampire Queen</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Marceline, who by this point is over a thousand years old, decides that she has had enough of her immortality. From the new lab which Bubblegum has constructed under Gumbald's shack, she is able to extract Marceline's vampire effluvium, effectively curing her vampirism and making her mortal. This also strips her of the various powers she has absorbed, and Marceline discovers she has arthritis in her legs due to flying everywhere. But Bubblegum is unsure whether or not the procedure has really worked, so she tells Marceline to get some sleep and wait until morning. That night, a local village's livestock are mysteriously attacked and drained of their blood. Being the only vampire in Ooo, Marceline is the prime suspect of the attack, and the villagers form a mob. They abduct Marceline, tie her to the top of their windmill, and wait for the sun to rise. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the actual attacker to a cave and discover that it is not Marceline. But by the time Finn discovers the villager's execution plans, the sun is already rising. [S07E06 <em>Marceline the Vampire Queen</em>]</p>
<p>Luckily, Bubblegum's cure has indeed worked. The sun can no longer harm Marceline. Jake, who wakes up in the cave after fainting, discovers the true culprits; a group of vampires manifested from Marceline's extracted effluvium. When he returns to the others, Marceline realises that the vampires are all the members of the ancient Vampire Court whose souls she absorbed; The Fool, The Empress, The Moon, The Heirophant, and The King. Peppermint Butler has been stockpiling anti-vampire weaponry in case Marceline ever decided to turn against his mistress. Together, Peppermint Butler, Bubblegum, Marceline, Finn, and Jake set out to track down all the vampires before they can return to full power and take over the whole of Ooo. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>]</p>
<p>It doesn't take Marceline long to discover The King and The Fool hiding out in the woods. Although The King claims to have changed his ways, Marceline doesn't believe him.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">Things are different now. The humans are long gone.</p>
  <p>Someone's smelling a bit human herself these days. Anyway, you don't need to worry. I've changed as well. I only eat animals now, just like everyone else. Does that mean we can be friends now, Marceline?</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline and The Vampire King [S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Marceline stakes The Fool and re-absorbs his soul and the power of flight. But she abandons her fight against The King after he tells her that The Empress is on her way to the Ice Kingdom. Fearing for Ice King, Marceline flies there immediately to try to take her down on her own. The Empress almost gets the better of Marceline, but Bubblegum comes to the rescue. Marceline stakes The Empress, sucks her soul, and regains the power of invisibility. After this, Marceline promises to stay with the others. [S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>, S07E09 <em>The Empress Eyes</em>]</p>
<p>Next on their list is The Moon, but before that they are intercepted by The Heirophant. He offers to team up with Marceline, but disagrees with her requirement that he must switch to drinking the colour red rather than actual blood. He proves a formidable adversary and poisons Marceline with scorpion venom. However, his weakness is the fact that he plays by "old timey rules" and cannot cross the threshold of a home without permission. Jake shape-shifts into a house and The Heirophant is pushed inside by Crunchy. Having violated the rule, he dies, and his soul is absorbed by Marceline. She regains her shape-shifting powers but is rapidly succumbing to the poison. [S07E10 <em>May I Come In?</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum sends Finn and Jake to capture The Moon while she and Peppermint Butler take Marceline back to Peppermint Butler's secret poison lab in the Candy Kingdom. The King of Ooo tries to stop them, but the banana guards still don't really recognise his authority over Bubblegum.</p>

  <p>Monarchies... are not... DEMOCRACIES!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Princess Bubblegum [S07E11 <em>Take Her Back</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Peppermint Butler's methods for healing the poison are either very slow or completely ineffective. Thankfully, Finn and Jake show up with The Moon. Peppermint Butler stakes her, and Marceline is able to quickly absorb her soul before she can heal the wound. With her healing powers restored, Marceline recovers from the poison. In a repetition of events from nearly a thousand years prior, this leaves The Vampire King as the last of his kind. [S07E11 <em>Take Her Back</em>]</p>
<p>But the Vampire King does not want things to repeat.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>How many times do you wanna do this, Marceline? Our lives have magnetised. We're in a negative loop. But we can change our outcome this time.</p>
  <p class="alt">I like the outcome where you get staked.</p>
  <p>And you become a vampire? Marceline. I know I was ruthless in the past. But tell me, what's the one thing you've noticed about the world, since you beat me all those hundreds of years ago?</p>
  <p class="alt">Everything repeats over and over again. No one learns anything, 'cause no one lives long enough to see the pattern, I guess.</p>

  <p class="alt">The other way's like a black hole; an unknown.</p>
  <p>I'm not afraid of the unknown! I have the power to change destiny! Queen of vampires! You weigh the scales of fate. Spill my guts, or face the unknown. Either way, I will not bite. For turning you would subjugate me to the wheel of fortune. And I am a king. Not a hamster.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Vampire King and Marceline [S07E12 <em>Checkmate</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>They come to a truce. The Vampire King decides that he no longer wishes to be a vampire, and asks Bubblegum to cure him as she did for Marceline. The procedure is successful a second time, and The King reverts to his mortal self; an ordinary lion. However, his vampire effluvium is even more potent than Marceline's. After Jake accidentally releases it, it manifests in the form of a gigantic cloud creature known as the Dark Cloud, and begins rampaging towards the Candy Kingdom. The accompanying explosion destroys Gumbald's cabin. [S07E12 <em>Checkmate</em>]</p>
<p>The candy people spot the impending monster. Seeing Bubblegum battle against it, and how apathetic the King of Ooo is in comparison to her, a revolution begins. Crunchy throws the King of Ooo into his fireplace, where he melts into a puddle of wax. Temporarily taking the role of princess, Crunchy orders the kingdom's infantry to help in the fight against the monster. And it is not only the banana guards who join the battle; many of the kingdom's other citizens also take up arms. Proud of her people, Bubblegum continues to battle along with Finn and Jake. The Fire Kingdom and Hot Dog Kingdom also assist their ally. But their attempts to take down the Dark Cloud are largely ineffectual. Luckily, after some words of encouragement from Ice King, Marceline gets over her own regret and decides to finish the monster once and for all. She is able to re-absorb its vampire essence and defeat it, but gets turned back into a vampire in the process. [S07E13 <em>The Dark Cloud</em>]</p>
<p>Following the revolution, Princess Bubblegum takes back her title and her throne. She offers Marceline the opportunity to move in with her, but Marceline declines, saying she needs a little time to herself. Nevertheless, she is glad to be immortal again, and glad that Bubblegum will be with her all the way.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good, but at the same time it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and...

<h3>Magic, Madness, and Sadness</h3>
<p>Betty has spent her time in Ooo devising a theory of magic which she calls MMS; a theory which states that all magic users harbour varying degrees of magic, madness, and sadness. She hopes to one day be able to apply her studies to saving Simon from the crown's curse.

Finn and Jake follow her to Magic Man's house, but Magic Man sees them approaching and turns them into a fried egg and a bowl of soup, respectively. Betty and Magic Man begin the reaction, which involves locking themselves in a trance state. While the reaction is taking place, Finn, as an egg, manages to get himself baked into a bread body in Magic Man's oven. Bread Finn destroys the apparatus and puts a premature stop to the reaction. The result of all this is that Magic Man's MMS is transferred to Betty, granting her magical powers in exchange for his own. Magic Man's side of the deal is unfulfilled. Since his name no longer applies, he renames himself "Normal Man".</p>

The virus is magical in nature, and as a result is a reflection of Betty herself. It recognises and falls in love with Simon's consciousness, giving up its pointless mission. The crown, now no longer under attack, re-establishes its defences and kicks out Marceline and Bubblegum. Ice King is returned to normal and Betty's plan has failed.

<p>Like with many of their responsibilities, Finn and Jake are arguably somewhat neglectful towards BMO for a long time. This leads to BMO having a highly developed network of imaginary relationships, mostly with animals and inanimate objects around the Tree Fort. He personifies his own reflection as an imaginary friend named Football. After getting kidnapped by a giant bird, BMO befriends a bubble (simply named Bubble) on his way back to the Tree Fort. After Bubble is popped by Jake, he becomes an invisible voice in BMO's head named Air who may or may not also be imaginary.

Moe passes away and gives AMO his memory backup, telling him to send it into space so he can rest in peace among the stars. However, AMO does not follow his creator's wish. He sees the love and compassion in the society of MOs who inhabit the factory and, in a jealous rage, uses knowledge from Moe's memories to hack them all and instruct them to do somersaults into the trash compactor. They are crushed into one amalgamated entity called ALLMO. After AMO learns about the happy loving life that BMO lives with Finn and Jake, he comes up with a devious plan to take his place. At BMO's "birthday party", AMO dresses up as Moe and pretends to be Moe's consciousness uploaded into a robot. He tells BMO that he must journey to the factory on a solo mission so that he can "learn how to be grown up". Finn and Jake are hesitant since they think it sounds too dangerous for BMO to handle on his own. But eventually they agree to let him go. AMO, under the guise of Moe, stays at the Tree Fort to act as a substitute for BMO while he is away. The mission obviously turns out to be fake. When BMO arrives at the factory he finds nothing but a trap designed to destroy him. He avoids the trap and rescues ALLMO and together they head back to the Tree Fort. BMO fights AMO and pushes him off a cliff to his death.</p>

  <p>That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess after all that I do feel a bit more grown. Except that the mission was just a made up lie. So who knows if I will ever grow up at all? And Moe is gone now, so if there is anything he wanted to teach me, better be in me already. I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me. Except that's what AMO did and he turned out bad. So what if I turn out bad too? But I'm different! It's not just Moe up here. It's me too. And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me!</p>

<h3>Peace in Farmworld</h3>
<p>Although Jake's wish in the Time Room appeared to erase the Farmworld timeline, it actually still persists as its own dimension. Following the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb, Farmworld Finn has been driven mad by Evergreen's crown, becoming "Ice Finn". The version of the Lich who still lives there intends to escape Farmworld by opening a portal to the Multiverse using Farmworld's copy of the Enchiridion. Prismo hires Finn and Jake from the prime Earth Dimension to travel to Farmworld and "take care" of Ice Finn so that he can't help the Lich open the portal, and gives them a weapon called "The Maid" with which to do so. However, they can't bring themselves to kill Ice Finn.</p>

<h3>The Return of Doctor Gross, and the Birth of Fern the Human</h3>
<p>At this point, Finn is still using the Finn Sword; the weapon created in the Time Room from his alternate self during the resurrection of Prismo. The sword has a voice and consciousness of its own but tends to stay quiet. One day, Finn loses the sword and it is stolen by an outlaw named Bandit Princess. In the ensuing duel between Finn and Bandit Princess, the Grass Sword re-emerges from Finn's arm to assist in the fight. But to Finn's horror, the Grass Sword either accidentally or deliberately impales the gem of the Finn Sword. He retrieves the sword, but the gem is irreparably damaged and the consciousness within it appears to be dead. He begins using the Root Sword again as a temporary replacement. [S08E05 <em>I Am a Sword</em>, S08E07 <em>Normal Man</em>]</p>
<p>Within the gem of the Finn Sword, the alternate version of Finn is joined by some kind of grass demon who begins to take over the inside of the sword for himself, and wishes to escape.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">Who are you?</p>
  <p>Oh, you know. A curse. An Emissary from Beyond. Some kind of grass octopus spider... Don't worry about me... I want outta here though. I've pretty much done all I can do in here. You and me; we could do a lot better out there.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Sword-Finn and the grass demon [S08E14 <em>Two Swords</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Along with this, Finn has been going through other difficult feelings. He worries that he is uncaring and narrow sighted like his father after a pair of cursed eyes cause him to temporarily kill Neptr, and he is somewhat traumatised after spending months, if not years, trapped in his own mind in the Hall of Egress. Guilty about the loss of his sword, he falls into another period of depression. Princess Bubblegum holds a battle of the bands to try to cheer him up and he meets the Music Hole. The Finn Sword appears to respond to this encounter, and Finn feels a little better. [S08E02 <em>Don't Look</em>, S07E24 <em>The Hall of Egress</em>, S08E10 <em>The Music Hole</em>]</p>
<p>Some time later, Finn and Jake go with Susan Strong to investigate some ancient parts of Beautopia which are uncovered during a low tide. While they are exploring, Doctor Gross' mobile lab burrows up from under the ground. They meet Tiffany, who Finn thought had died in the maw of a giant worm during their joint military service at Dentist. He in fact survived, and has been taken on as Doctor Gross' apprentice. They also meet Doctor Gross herself. Since escaping the Islands, she has continued to experiment on animals and develop new hybrids. She tries to perform modifications of Finn, Jake, and Susan without their consent, but they escape and destroy the mobile lab in the process. Doctor Gross is likely killed in the explosion, but Tiffany survives yet another near death experience.

<p class="note">Note: According to Ted Anderson's AMA on Discord, the final arc of Season 11 intended to reveal that Doctor Gross survived. But since the series was cancelled, I am not going to consider that to be the case.</p>
<p>However, Susan's implanted chip is rebooted during the encounter. Her own mind is overtaken by the chip, which resumes its previously failed mission to retrieve Finn and his father and bring them back to the Islands. Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum battle Susan until Finn is eventually able to destroy her chip and return her to normal. But during the battle, the Grass Sword emerges again. It knocks out Susan and then detaches from Finn, taking his whole arm with it once again. The grass entity encounters the Finn Sword and they merge together into a new being: a grass clone of Finn.

<p>Understandably, the grass clone has an identity crisis. He has within him two voices; the voice of Sword-Finn, who initially doesn't realise he's not the real Finn, and the malevolent voice of the Emissary from Beyond. Finn and Jake decide to let him stay at the Tree Fort. Princess Bubblegum gives Finn a new bionic arm which she has been working on ever since he lost it the first time, to replace the one taken by the grass clone. Feeling guilty for Susan's hospitalisation, Finn decides to stay in the hospital and try to be a doctor for a while, although this doesn't go well. He finds a new sword at some point; a sabre-like blade named the "Small Sword". Meanwhile, Jake and the grass clone head to Grassy Wizard's dominion to try to find out why he created the Grass Sword in the first place. The grass clone is less than thrilled to learn that his existence is entirely meaningless; Grassy Wizard created the sword because he "thought it would be cool". The grass clone realises that in order to be fulfilled he needs to become his own person, so he comes up with a new name for himself and rides out into the world.

<h3>The Veritas Brigade</h3>
<p>The Veritas Brigade, the "secret" society who had some involvement in the election of the King of Ooo, was originally established by Starchy, the candy person gravedigger who hosts the radio call-in show <em>The Graveyard Shift</em>. They begin as a group who attempt to uncover conspiracies and supernatural happenings within the Candy Kingdom. One of their members is Peace Master, a magician who detects significant dark magic within the Candy Kingdom and believes it to be the work of Princess Bubblegum, threatening her via the surveillance camera which she is using to watch their meeting. However, the actual culprit is Peppermint Butler. He and Peace Master eventually confront one another in the Wizard Battle Arena, and Peppermint Butler wins him over by threatening to turn his children into evil monsters. [S06E15 <em>Nemesis</em>]</p>
<p>It is following this and the brief lizard takeover of the Candy Kingdom that the Veritas Brigade becomes a much more political group who oppose Princess Bubblegum's autocratic rule and accuse her of being a fascist. As previously mentioned, they support the King of Ooo's campaign during the democratisation of the Candy Kingdom. It is Starchy who announces the outcome of the election, perhaps hinting at some form of vote rigging. [S05E39 <em>We Fixed a Truck</em>, S08E17 <em>High Strangeness</em>, S06E42 <em>Hot Diggity Doom</em>]</p>
<p>After Tree Trunks voices her concerns about Princess Bubblegum's ever-expanding space program, she is approached by Starchy and asked to join the Veritas Brigade. One of Bubblegum's space probes impacts with the spaceship belonging to Tree Trunks' polyamorous alien consorts and hybrid children. Tree Trunks, who is already on bad terms with Princess Bubblegum due to the outcome of her wedding, believes it to be a deliberate attack on her extraterrestrial family. Bubblegum's actual intention is to seed new candy life on uninhabited worlds. The Veritas Brigade attempts to raid a vehicle assembly building on the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom in order to shut down the program, but they are caught by Bubblegum. However, Tree Trunks abducts Bubblegum into the spaceship to show her the damage she is causing first hand. They come to a mutual agreement, and Tree Trunks' alien husband agrees to take the candy probes back to his own abandoned home planet where they will be able to thrive and grow.</p>

<p>Following the activation of Susan's chip, an autonomous transport craft is dispatched from the human Islands to pick her up. The defences of the Candy Kingdom are overwhelmed by the craft's superior technology while it searches for Susan. It finds Finn and asks him to assist with the search. But before Finn can get any more information from it, it is destroyed by Jake. Princess Bubblegum deduces that the craft is human technology, and BMO interfaces with the ship's computer and discovers its origin; Founders' Island. [S08E20 <em>The Invitation</em>]</p>
<p>Finn, Jake, and Susan quickly organise an expedition to this previously unknown island. They borrow the Sugar Spit, a boat belonging to Princess Bubblegum which Jake had previously borrowed to travel to the Card Wars Doubles Classic. Finn entrusts Fern, who has taken up residence on the roof of the Tree Fort, to look after the Land of Ooo while he's away. BMO, once again displaying his newly discovered taste for adventure, stows away on board the ship. While Finn claims that he's only going because he thinks it would be "cool" to meet some other humans, Princess Bubblegum worries that it might be something more.

Jake uses his shape-shifting powers to take on the role of the boat after the Sugar Spit is destroyed. Whipple forgives them for finding him annoying, and blows them a tailwind which quickly flies them all the way to the border of the islands. However, they are intercepted by the Guardian, who capsizes the boat and separates its crew. [S08E21 <em>Whipple the Happy Dragon</em>]</p>
<p>Finn and Jake wash up separately on Back-to-Nature Island. Finn encounters the malfunctioning weather system and some of the strange wildlife which wiped out the attempted human colony back in the day. He also finds Alva, the first human encounter of their journey, although she only speaks Swedish so he isn't able to find anything out from her. After being reunited with Jake, Alva draws them a map of the four islands and they depart on the back of a giant parrot to try to find Susan and BMO. [S08E22 <em>Mysterious Island</em>]</p>
<p>The next island they arrive on is the home of <em>Better Reality</em>, the VR game which many humans have been playing for their whole lives.

<p>They travel by tube to the ruins of Hub Island, which was abandoned following Doctor Gross' epidemic. On its shores they find Susan. The familiar surroundings trigger a sudden reflux of her memories, and she regains the ability to speak properly. She also remembers her real name: Kara.

It doesn't take long for Finn to find his mother; or at least, someone who looks and sounds like his mother. She actually turns out to be one of the hundreds of Minerva-bots who look after the people of the island.

<p>Before their departure to the Islands, Finn and Jake investigate the theft of wire hangers throughout the Candy Kingdom and discover that the perpetrator is Ice King, who is making a chain out of them to retrieve some keys he dropped down a deep crack in his castle. However, when Finn, Jake, and Ice King drill into the crack to find the keys, they discover something far more interesting; the frozen form of Patience St Pim, the Ice Elemental who froze herself a thousand years prior to escape the Mushroom War. After being thawed, she allies herself with Ice King and tells him to round up the other Elementals: Flame Princess, Princess Bubblegum, and Slime Princess. But the other three are not even aware of the fact that they are Elementals, and they do not react kindly to being kidnapped and "reunited" with somebody they've never met.</p>

<p>After Finn, Jake, BMO, and Susan leave for the Islands, Patience begins to enact her plan to cast the elemental purification spell over the Land of Ooo.

Given her previous plans to save him from the crown haven't worked, she decides to try a more direct approach, and invites him on a date. Ice King is more than thrilled. But when Betty isn't able to coax any of Simon's old memories out of Ice King's twisted and broken mind, she freaks out and ends the date abruptly. After a conversation with Tiny Manticore she realises that her efforts may be fruitless, and it might be better to just make the most of what she has.</p>

  <p>The princesses and I are the Elementals incarnate. But the others didn't want to play with me. They denied their precious birthright.

I have distilled them into something monstrous.</p>

</div>
<p>A small selection of Ooo's inhabitants escape these fates. Ice King and Gunter escape to Cloud Kingdom, along with Ice King's stolen wire hangers which he calls his "skyhooks". Sweet P is unaffected by the changes due to his true nature, but his parents are converted to candy and he runs away from them. Lumpy Space Princess is unaffected due to being the Lumps Anti-Elemental. Cinnamon Bun is in the Fire Kingdom at the time, and his flame shield protects him from the changes. [S09E02 <em>Skyhooks</em>, S09E03 <em>Bespoken For</em>, S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S09E06 <em>Happy Warrior</em>]</p>
<p>Marceline somehow avoids conversion initially. She travels to the ice quadrant to confront Patience and tries to find out how to reverse the spell. She discovers that each element can be spread by songs pertaining to their related emotion, and tries to use this information to cure Bubblegum, but to no avail. She gives in to her fate and is converted to candy, becoming "Marshmaline the Campfire Queen". [S09E13 <em>Ketchup</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Finn, Jake, and BMO are on the boat on their way back to the Land of Ooo from the Islands. They meet Nightmare Princess, who trades them a vial of Nightmare Juice in return for the cargo of bananas they were hauling. They make land in the north west of Ooo; the quadrant which has been converted to candy. Immediately, they begin to realise the extent to which Ooo has changed. Their own Tree Fort has been turned to candy, and Fern, Neptr, Shelby the Worm, and Lemongrab have all been converted into permanently joyful versions of themselves. While Jake initially thinks this might not be such a bad thing, they quickly realise that the people they meet are empty shadows of their former selves, unable to experience any emotion other than joy. Sweet P has managed to avoid being candified, but is pursued by his terrifying candified parents. Wanting to get to the bottom of these bizarre changes, Finn and Jake learn that Princess Bubblegum is at the top of the tower. They meet Marshmaline on the way there. Princess Bubblegum reveals her new nature as the purified Candy Elemental and attempts to candify Finn and Jake, but they are fortunately rescued by Ice King, who uses the skyhooks as a grappling line to pull them up to the safety of his cloud. BMO is lost to the candy. [S09E01 <em>Orb</em>, S09E02 <em>Skyhooks</em>]</p>
<p>Together, Finn, Jake, and the Ice King organise a mission to Patience's home in the ice quadrant to rescue Betty. They meet Carol the former cloud person, who has been frozen into a solid icy state. After they tell her they are planning on "taking out" Patience, Carol goes ahead of them and warns Patience of their arrival. They meet Patience at a reception she had planned for the other Elementals, but which the other Elementals never attended. While Patience regrets her decision to enact the spell, she is too apathetic towards the entire situation to actually bother trying to help them fix it. Jake is almost converted to one of the ice people, but Finn and Ice King manage to escape with him and the frozen Betty, and thaw them both back in Cloud Kingdom. Finn gives Betty the Farmworld Enchiridion and she begins studying it to try to figure out a counter-spell to revert things back to normal, and comes up with a plan. She tells Finn and Jake that if they retrieve the crown jewels from the three elemental princesses, she'll be able to cast the counter-spell. But her actual plan is something different... [S09E04 <em>Winter Light</em>, S09E05 <em>Cloudy</em>]</p>
<p>Finn and Jake's first stop is the slime quadrant. Slime Princess is hosting a competitive roller-skate dance party. Finn and Jake meet LSP and compete to be assimilated into Slime Princess' huge form so they can grab her crown and escape. But during the assimilation, Jake gives in and lets himself be taken. Luckily, Finn grabs the crown and LSP, who can't be assimilated due to unknowingly being the Anti-Elemental, saves him. They are kicked out of the party and head back to Cloud Kingdom together.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p class="alt">I got the jewel... but I lost Jake... You're not a slime person?</p>
  <p>No, I totally faked it. I just saw this lumpalicious party and I was like, "These are my people!" But even though I shoplifted this super-cool outfit, I still didn't fit in.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Finn and LSP [S09E06 <em>Slime Central</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Next, they visit the fire quadrant to retrieve Flame Princess' jewel. The entire kingdom is in one giant ongoing senseless brawl. They meet Cinnamon Bun, who takes them to the old throne room. They find Flame Princess there, who has been transformed into a giant dragon. Finn gets caught up in the fighting and ends up being converted into an enraged flame person. LSP tries to convince everyone to stop fighting each other. The flame people actually listen to her, but instead of fighting each other they begin marching on the candy quadrant. [S09E07 <em>Happy Warrior</em>]</p>
<p>LSP uses gum from Princess Bubblegum's tower to remind Finn who he really is, and he returns to normal. Meanwhile, Bubblegum begins exploiting the power of song to expand her own dominion. She candifies the invaders from the fire quadrant, and begins to extend her influence into the other quadrants. Patience St Pim, watching her new home melt and candify, decides that her best option is to re-freeze herself and try again in another thousand years or so. Finn is able to snag the jewels from Princess Bubblegum and the now candified Flame Princess, and gives them to Betty, but she simply takes the jewels and the Enchiridion and flies away without him. She has her own plan. [S09E08 <em>Hero Heart</em>, S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>People say you shouldn't live in the past. But I say: Why not? This book is strange, but when you puzzle it out, it's mostly all charges and frequencies. Instead of fixing Ooo, I can use these jewels to make a portal to take me back in time and find Simon <em>before</em> he discovers the crown! This time I won't let him put it on. I'll drop it in a volcano before that happens. Things will be back to being just me and Simon. And you won't exist! No more Ice King. No more magic Betty. Maybe I can even stop the Mushroom War! My wonderful Simon will never become this sad pathetic creature strewn before me. I thought I could do it, but I can't. Being with you is like looking at my old life through a fun-house mirror. It's driving me mad! Goodbye, Ice King.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Betty [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>But Ice King doesn't like the sound of that. He interrupts Betty's spell casting halfway through and prevents her from creating the portal to the past. Instead, it backfires and sends her to Mars. Meanwhile, Finn and LSP figure out how to activate LSP's anti-elemental powers, and with the help of the elemental jewels and Evergreen's crown she is able to save the whole of the Land of Ooo by turning it back to normal. In some cases, she converts things even more "back to normal" than usual; her powers undo a lot of additional transfiguration magic. Jake is released from his assimilation with Slime Princess, but in the process he loses his yellow pigmentation and takes on a blue hue more accurate to his true heritage. Sweet P grows back his missing horn. And unbeknownst to anyone else, Gumbald, Lolly, and Chicle are released from their imprisonment. [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S10E05 <em>Seventeen</em>]</p>

<h3>A Battle in Many Worlds</h3>
<p>Following the elemental takeover, Fern suffers a massive loss of confidence in his own abilities. He believes that the fact he was unable to stop Patience proves that he is an inferior hero to Finn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a great threat looms over the Land of Ooo. When the Lich's hand fell into the portal in Farmworld, it duplicated across every dimension in the Multiverse. The copy which ended up on Earth begins attempting to awaken Sweet P's inner darkness by whispering to him at night. One night, he runs away from home to escape the whispers and ends up running into Finn and Fern. Finn tells Fern to guard Sweet P while he goes to fight the Lich, just in case Sweet P turns evil. They return to the Well of Power for a final showdown. Across the Multiverse, the same battle is happening in every dimension.</p>

<p>Eventually, Fern goes through with his plan to replace Finn. He tricks Finn into accompanying him to a ziggurat dungeon where he locks him inside a stone chamber. Finn, realising that he has been betrayed, discovers that his bionic arm comes with a myriad of additional features, including a rock drill which he uses to escape the chamber. It also has a "weed whacker" feature. He intercepts Fern and they battle it out. In the end, Finn accidentally disintegrates his clone. He returns to the Tree Fort alone, distraught by the belief that he has killed Fern. [S09E14 <em>Two Buckets</em>]</p>

<h3>Shape-Shifters</h3>
<p>Jake tries to take his changing body with an open mind, insisting that despite his new appearance he is still the same person. But his somewhat monstrous form scares BMO and makes other people uneasy. After meeting Jermaine in a dream again, they meet up in real life at Jermaine's new art studio in the wastelands. Jake is surprised to find that Jermaine has switched from painting realistic landscapes to painting abstract art and suspects that something is wrong with him.

<p>Some time later, Kim Kil Whan asks Finn and Jake to investigate some strange happenings at one of the properties owned by his company: the former residence of Finn and Jake's family, Joshua and Margaret Investigations. They discover that the perpetrator is Clock Bear, one of the creatures who escaped Doctor Gross' menagerie. He causes several "time slips" between the 980s and 1001 AMB, making the house seem haunted. This also allows the future versions of Finn and Jake to subtly interact with their dead parents, and future Jake witnesses his own unconventional birth. After repairing Clock Bear and stopping the time slips, Jake meets a mysterious figure in an alleyway beside the house. It turns out to be Warren Ampersand, the shape-shifter who is Jake's biological father, and Jake willingly goes with him to his home planet of Nerraw.

<p>As he has done with many of his previous children, Warren Ampersand tricks Jake into stretching while wearing a special belt so that he can siphon off his son's stretchy essence and extend his own lifespan at the expense of Jake's. However, Jake is able to switch their belts and carries out a counter-trick. Old and near death, Warren tries to escape Nerraw and travel to Earth to find Jake's children and drain their power instead, but his spacecraft is grabbed by Jake, who throws him into the black hole orbiting the planet.

Betty is one of his subjects, having been teleported to Mars following her failed attempt to travel back in time. She is busy filling an immense hole with sand one grain at a time, which Normal Man claims will help her get over the loss of Simon. To locate Jake, Normal Man tells Finn and Jermaine that they must travel through a set of challenges to activate a "space telemetry capsule" which will teleport him back to Mars. The challenges represent the respective emotional turmoil of Finn and Betty, with the intention being to help Betty learn to move on. They reach the end and Jake is successfully rescued.

<p>Following the reversal of Patience St Pim's elemental spell by Lumpy Space Princess' anti-elemental influence, the effects of the Dum Dum juice from eight hundred years prior are also reversed. The trio lay low for a while. Their absences are noticed by Bubblegum, who has missing posters put up in and around the Candy Kingdom. They commandeer the ziggurat and turn it into their base. Soon, Gumbald comes across the remains of Fern following his "death" at the hands of Finn, and collects up the pieces. Gumbald begins experimenting with creating candy based life, just like his niece Princess Bubblegum, and creates some monsters with which to gauge the strength of the modern Candy Kingdom and its allies. [S10E02 <em>Always BMO Closing</em>, S09E14 <em>Three Buckets</em>]</p>
<p>One of the monsters he creates is a banana fudge monster which begins attacking the banana guards' barracks at night. Finn and Jake are tasked with taking down the mysterious monster. However, Finn has been unable to slay any monsters since he killed Fern due to a paralysing sense of guilt which overcomes him every time he's about to deliver a finishing blow, and makes him see a reflection of Fern in the faces of his victims. With Huntress Wizard's help, he is able to find a way to overcome this paralysis by projecting Fern's face upon those he is trying to save, rather than those he is trying to kill, and he slays the beast (which Huntress names "the Grumbo"). Huntress Wizard, however, believes that his decisive actions in the face of guilt are for a different reason.</p>

<p>Despite previously claiming that they are unsuitable for each other, Huntress shares a kiss with Finn.

[S10E01 <em>The Wild Hunt</em>, <em>Season 11 #6</em>]</p>
<p>Gumbald's second anonymous attack occurs after BMO, while playing as a door-to-door salesperson along with the Ice King, sells a pouch of Finn's baby teeth to him in exchange for a silver goblet. Gumbald's mistake in this transaction is the fact that the goblet has his logo on it. Gumbald engineers the baby teeth into tiny baby tooth clones of Finn but they are easily defeated by Finn and Jake. Bubblegum, after recognising the logo on the goblet and given the disappearance of the three candy people, puts two and two together and realises that her family must have returned. [S10E02 <em>Always BMO Closing</em>, S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>The Candy Kingdom goes on high alert. Bubblegum hosts Finn's seventeenth birthday party but restricts the guest list to minimise risk. Despite these precautions, the party is intruded by an individual calling himself the Green Knight, who rides on a mechanical horse and has mysterious shielding technology which Bubblegum is unable to counteract. The Green Knight initially challenges Finn to a fight to the death but Finn manages to convince him that they should play party games instead. After defeating Finn, the Green Knight reveals that he is actually Fern, reconstructed and resurrected by his new allies: Gumbald, Lolly, and Chicle. The three gum people emerge from the mechanical horse, confirming Princess Bubblegum's suspicions that they had returned. But for now, their intention is merely to give Bubblegum a warning, and they decide to leave the party in peace.</p>

<p>Having recognised that Marceline is a major roadblock to their attempts to get revenge on Bubblegum, Cousin Chicle is dispatched to try to discover if she has a weakness. At the same time, Peppermint Butler is forging a new sword for Finn. He has it enchanted by Hunson Abadeer and names it the Night Sword. Hunson wishes to see his daughter so Finn and Jake escort him to Marceline. At Marceline's concert later that night, Chicle attempts to use their shaky relationship to his advantage and convinces a group of ghosts to beat up Hunson, but Marceline and her father escape with help from Finn and the Night Sword. [S10E07 <em>Marcy & Hunson</em>]</p>
<p>Gumbald floods the Land of Ooo using a copy of the Enchiridion from another dimension and attempts to frame Princess Bubblegum so that he can replace her as ruler of the Candy Kingdom, but this plan is foiled by Finn, Jake, BMO, and Marceline. [<em>Pirates of the Enchiridion</em>]</p>
<p>By now, Gumbald, Lolly, and Chicle have established their own kingdom named Gumbaldia. The conflict between the Candy Kingdom and Gumbaldia escalates into a full scale arms race, with both sides believing that the other is giving them no choice but to build up their armaments. Gumbald begins amassing an army of his own candy-based creations and building a massive robot named "The Cake" to rival the Gumball Guardians. He also establishes what he calls the "Legion of Candy Kingdom Haters", consisting of many of the Candy Kingdom's old enemies; Ricardio, Bandit Princess, Samantha, Peace Master, Me-Mow, Pete Sassafras, Ash, Sir Slicer, Scorcher, the Green Knight, and Ice King (who thinks he might have been invited by mistake).

<p>Finn and Jake secretly leave on a last ditch diplomatic mission to Gumbaldia to try to talk Uncle Gumbald, Aunt Lolly, and Cousin Chicle out of going to war against the Candy Kingdom. However, Lolly uses this as an opportunity to carry out a devious plan. The three of them pretend to be enamoured by Finn's diplomacy and send him back with a peace treaty. They also splash Finn and Jake with liquid from what they call their "celebration bucket" which is in fact Dum Dum Juice. Some of it ends up getting on Chicle but he manages to escape the room before Finn and Jake see his transformation back into Crunchy, so they don't realise what's going on. Fortunately, Princess Bubblegum does not touch Finn or Jake when they return to the Candy Kingdom. Peppermint Butler, however, is not so lucky. The Dum Dum Juice converts him into a stupefied baby version of himself. Princess Bubblegum, realising that the entire diplomatic mission was a botched attempt on her life, immediately mobilises her army, and the Great Gum War officially begins.

<p>The two armies set up their respective camps on each side of a canyon between the territory controlled by the Candy Kingdom and that which has already been annexed by Gumbaldia.

<p>Finn and Jake, while scouting for the Candy Kingdom, spot some unexpected visitors above the battlefield; Normal Man, Betty, and the still comatose Maja. They bring this information back to Bubblegum, but there isn't much time to think about this development before things start kicking off.</p>
<p>After Huntress Wizard captures a Gumbaldian scout who has already relayed Princess Bubblegum's tactics back to Gumbald and Lolly, Bubblegum decides she has no choice but to begin the battle immediately. The two armies meet in the middle of the canyon and establish their lines, each waiting in a stand-off for the other to attack first. On the side of Princess Bubblegum and the Candy Kingdom stands Bubblegum's army of banana guards and the two Gumball Guardians, as well as notable allies such as the Duke of Nuts, the Earl of Lemongrab, Flame Princess, Slime Princess, Huntress Wizard, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, Jake, and Finn. On the side of Gumbaldia stands the new army of candy people created by Gumbald, as well as The Cake and the Legion of Candy Kingdom Haters.</p>
<p>Now that both sides have seen the full might of the other, Finn manages to convince Bubblegum that Gumbald could have changed his mind about wanting to fight the Candy Kingdom, and there could still be a chance to de-escalate things. Remembering all that Finn has done for her, in this life and before, Bubblegum agrees to give diplomacy one last try. Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, Gumbald, and the Green Knight meet at the centre of no man's land. As Finn expects, this doesn't go any better than the previous attempts to talk down Bubblegum and Gumbald, but this time he has a trick up his sleeve. Jake pops the mysterious vial of nightmare juice given to them by Nightmare Princess on the boat trip back from the Islands, and the five of them fall unconscious and enter a shared dream. [S10E13 <em>Come Along With Me Part 1</em>]</p>
<p>During the dream, Gumbald and Bubblegum are each shown the tormented lives which the other have lead ever since the day Gumbald first betrayed his niece. Princess Bubblegum has let her kingdom and her people grow into something she no longer feels she can support, and Gumbald has been trapped, unable to assist her in any meaningful way. Meanwhile, Finn and the Green Knight also resolve their own conflict. Jake finds their shared vault buried deep within the fabric of the dream, and together they confront all their greatest fears. One of them is the Emissary from Beyond; the creature who embodies the cursed spirit of the Grass Sword. Fern impales the creature with a chair leg, killing it swiftly. The five dreamers all gather on a beach at the end of the dream, while the Cosmic Owl flies overhead to cement its events into reality.</p>
<p>After waking up, Fern finds that without the Grass Sword's curse to hold him together, he is disintegrating. Meanwhile, Princess Bubblegum decides that she wants to come to a peaceful resolution.</p>

<p>Just as the armies are beginning to disband, a portal appears in the sky above the canyon. Normal Man falls through it, shortly followed by the enormous figure of GOLB; the embodiment of chaos and the most powerful being in the Multiverse. Betty's new plan is revealed: she wants to harness GOLB's ability to revert things to their "essential forms" in order to remove the curse of Evergreen's crown from Simon once and for all. But while she is trying to cast a spell to have this happen, GOLB begins to attack. Many of the Gumbaldian soldiers become amalgamated into a frightful monster which wreaks havoc upon both armies. The Legion of Candy Kingdom Haters flee the battle, but Aunt Lolly remains, and fights using the Cake alongside Princess Bubblegum's Gumball Guardians and her other allies. But this is not enough; the combined forces of both kingdoms cannot slay the monster. The Gumball Guardians, which have loyally served the kingdom for hundreds of years, are destroyed. One of them is smashed open, and the other is turned into a second hideous monster.</p>
<p>In the midst of the battle, some of the belligerents find the time to confess their love for one another in what could potentially be the final moments of their lives. Lemongrab and Lumpy Space Princess, who have been dating, make their relationship known by kissing on the battlefield. Marceline also finds herself revealing her true feelings after believing that Princess Bubblegum has been killed by the amalgamation. After all they've been through in the past few years, having rekindled their friendship and eventually their romance, Marceline can't bear the idea of losing her a second time. She pummels the monster to pieces using her latent ability to summon the Dark Cloud, and upon discovering to her relief that Bubblegum was saved by her emergency force field, the pair share a kiss.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Normal Man seeks out Ice King and encourages him to try to talk to Betty, to prevent her from casting the spell. Normal Man, Ice King, and Finn fly up to Betty's flying carpet, where they find her attached to Maja with jumper cables. Ice King still doesn't recognise Betty, which only succeeds in further angering her. This surge of emotion travels down the jumper cables and awakens Maja from her coma, but her ability to harness sentimentality is overloaded by Betty's rage and she dies in a violent explosion. The explosion knocks Ice King and Betty directly into the open mouth of GOLB, and Finn leaps in after in an attempt to rescue them. He makes it into the mouth just before GOLB knashes his teeth together and traps them inside. Finn's bionic arm is severed from his body and falls to the battlefield below. Within GOLB's stomach, the three begin to get "digested"; they are stripped down to their most fundamental forms as part of the process of removing them from existence. Finn remains an amputee, as he has always been destined to lose his arm. Betty returns to how she was before she was driven mad by Magic Man's powers. And finally, Ice King is reverted back into his true fundamental form: Simon Petrikov. Evergreen's crown appears to deactivate. Betty is thrilled that she has finally succeeded in curing Simon's madness, and they share their first kiss since before the Mushroom War. But with only minutes left until they are consumed by GOLB, her joy is short-lived.</p>

<p>The forces of the Candy Kingdom and Gumbaldia have been largely defeated by this point. Despite having taken a beating from the enraged Marceline, the amalgamation reconstitutes its body, and together with the turned Gumball Guardian it begins to rampage through the Land of Ooo. Jake uses the full extent of his powers to take on the monsters, but even he is not strong enough. The monsters destroy a large portion of the Candy Kingdom's capital, and to Jake's horror they completely and irreparably obliterate the Tree Fort. [<em>Season 11 #1</em>, S10E15 <em>Come Along With Me Part 3</em>]</p>
<p>Jake, shocked and alone, curls up into a ball in the wreckage of his home until he is found by BMO, whose faceplate was broken during the destruction of the Tree Fort but who is otherwise unharmed. BMO begins singing to Jake, which attracts the attention of the monsters. But to Jake's surprise, BMO's singing appears to repel the monsters and make him invulnerable to their attacks. Marceline and Bubblegum fly past at this point, and Bubblegum realises what's happening.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Oh duh! GOLB is discord. It's the harmony. Harmony hurts them!</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Princess Bubblegum and BMO [S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Together, they head back to the battlefield where Bubblegum orders all of her remaining allies to harmonise along with BMO's song. With the combined harmony and focussed magical intention of all of the kingdom's friends, the song begins to easily penetrate GOLB's previously indestructible skin, boring a hole all the way through to his stomach. Finn and Simon, who were about ready to give up, suddenly find a route open for them to escape through. But Betty has another idea. She realises that the crown has not deactivated. It has merely reverted to how it was before the original Gunther wished to be like his master Evergreen. It no longer turns the wearer into an ice elemental. Instead, it will grant its wearer their deepest truest wish, just as it was originally intended to do.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Go. There's something I have to do first. I figured out what's wrong with the crown. It reset! Just like us! It's in its primal wishing form now. This world will end unless GOLB is banished so I'm gonna make... a wish. I have to do it here. The crown could revert once we leave. I gamed it out. I'm sorry for messing everything up.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Betty [S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Finn and Simon escape GOLB's innards, but the hole formed by the music closes up behind them, leaving Betty trapped. Within GOLB, she attempts to wish for his banishment, but it fails. Not even wish magic can defeat the ultimate power in the Multiverse. So instead, she wishes for Simon's safety, by any means necessary. The crown does not destroy or banish GOLB. Instead, it merges together GOLB's consciousness with that of Betty. Under Betty's influence, the new entity leaves Earth peacefully to a destination unknown. The crown falls to the ground, its wish once again reset. It is picked up by Gunter, and although Jake initially panics, thinking that Orgalorg is going to try to use it to do something evil, he instead wishes for something far more innocent. Gunter, like Evergreen's dinosaur servant before him, wishes to be like his master. He transforms into the likeness of the Ice King, a happy babbling individual who becomes known as the "Ice Thing".</p>
<p>Finally, the conflict is over and the day is won, but not without its losses. Simon is distraught by losing Betty for the second time. And without the Emissary from Beyond holding him together, Fern has spent the last of his energy fighting alongside his friends.</p>
<div class="quote">

<p>Although the war is finished, the adventures of Ooo's inhabitants are far from over.</p>
<p>Immediately after the war, Princess Bubblegum begins the process of rebuilding the parts of the Candy Kingdom which were destroyed. A future version of Hunson Abadeer abducts Finn and Jake a thousand years into the future for help with his devious plan to erase Marceline's memories of Ooo, but his plan is foiled by Finn, Jake, Marceline, Bubblegum, and Simon. Additionally, the present day version of Hunson Abadeer recognises that what his future self did was wrong, meaning those events might have been retroactively prevented. Finn obtains a new sword at some point. It is not known why he stopped using the Night Sword. [<em>Season 11 #1</em> to <em>#4</em>]</p>
<p>Aunt Lolly becomes the ruler of Gumbaldia, which peacefully coexists alongside the Candy Kingdom. Punchy and Crunchy, the Dum Dum versions of Gumbald and Chicle, happily reintegrate into Candy Kingdom society, although their true selves are presumably still trapped within their minds. [S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>, <em>Season 11 #5</em>]</p>
<p>After a while, Marceline mostly moves out of her house and into the castle to live permanently with Princess Bubblegum now that their relationship is out in the open, taking up the offer which Bubblegum initially gave her following the defeat of the Vampire Court. Finn and Jake remain undecided about where they should live, initially just camping out under Fern's tree amongst the wreckage of the Tree Fort. Jake considers moving in with Lady Rainicorn, or suggests that they both move into Marceline's old house or into the Candy Kingdom capital. [<em>Season 11 #5</em>]</p>
<p>This dilemma is further complicated by the arrival of the humans in Ooo. Several ships full of humans finally make the journey from the Islands to the mainland and establish a colony named "Humantown", but their isolationist leader, Leader Malloy, establishes a policy stating that contact with the rest of Ooo and its "mutant" inhabitants should be kept to a minimum. This means that if Finn goes to live there, he will have to leave the colony to visit any of his friends, including Jake. [<em>Season 11 #5</em>, <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It might be better for all of our people if you simply... leave us alone. Don't get me wrong! We appreciate your offers of assistance. But for the moment, we believe Humantown should remain isolated. There is one person I will allow to visit Humantown... Young Finn, here! As the only known human living in Ooo, you're an honorary citizen. You've got entry and exit permissions to the city, any time. And if you ever want to move in, you're more than welcome. As far as I'm concerned, this is where you belong.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Leader Malloy [<em>Season 11 #5</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The human colony also brings a Minerva-bot to the Land of Ooo, giving Finn an opportunity to speak to his mother again; or at least, whatever she became after uploading her brain into an AI. They talk about all the things which have happened in Ooo since Finn visited the Islands, and he opens up to her about the death of Fern.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>I had a brother. Not, like, a brother from you. Not like Jake and Jermaine, either. His name was Fern. He was... He was me, but sent through time and turned into a sword, and then merged with a weird grass thing... I don't really know what he was. And neither did he. He wanted to be a hero, like me. Really, he wanted to be me. But he already was me, kinda. And he lived in a world that had a me. So he didn't know what he should be. What he could be. I think he died before he could find out.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Finn [<em>Season 11 #5</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Humantown is attacked by a monster, which turns out to be a robot under the control of Leader Malloy for testing whether Finn would come to the colony's aid. Finn, disappointed by this deception, chooses not to live in Humantown. Instead, with the help of many of his friends, he builds a wooden house for himself halfway between Humantown and the Candy Kingdom. [<em>Season 11 #5</em> and <em>#6</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Simon embarks on an "apology tour" of the Land of Ooo to make amends for all the bad things he did while he was the Ice King. He grants Gunter (AKA the Ice Thing) permission to rule to Ice Kingdom in his stead. Marceline organises for Flame Princess to thaw the parts of Cloud Kingdom which Ice King froze around a year prior, causing Cloud Kingdom to rain for the first time in centuries. It's possible that this is how Carol, having transitioned through the other two phases of water, finally becomes a water nymph. However, while all of this is very nice, Simon begins to lose his memories of his time as Ice King.

<div class="quote">
  <p>And yes, those were my darkest days, but they hold some of my brightest memories, too. Hanging with the two of you. Becoming a wizard. Watching Marceline grow up. My last days with Betty. I can't forget it! It's... it's who I am now.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Simon [<em>Marcy & Simon #1</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Bubblegum tries to restore these memories by extracting them from the copy of Simon's consciousness stored in Evergreen's crown, but this is unsuccessful. With the help of Peppermint Butler, who has been relearning his dark magic since the Dum Dum juice was used on him, they go to the Nightosphere to try to get Hunson Abadeer's help. But Hunson gets jealous of Simon's relationship with his daughter, and rather than just restoring Simon's memories of his time as the Ice King, he casts a "Character Curse". The personalities of Simon and Ice King battle for control of his body. Princess Bubblegum decides that the only way to cure his split personality is via a true love's kiss; specifically, a kiss from Betty. But Betty is still trapped in a merged state with GOLB, so Finn, Jake, Simon, Marceline, and BMO gear up for a journey through the Multiverse... [<em>Marcy & Simon #2</em> to <em>#4</em>]</p>

<p>At some point, Simon travels to the Time Room to try to wish Betty back into existence, but just like Magic Man before him, he discovers that not even wish magic can bring back someone who has been lost to GOLB. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>, S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</p>
<p>It is not known whether or not Lumpy Space Princess and the Earl of Lemongrab remain in their relationship. Lumpy Space Princess is crowned ruler of Lumpy Space, meaning that her parents have finally decided that she is responsible enough for the position, which finally earns her the respect of the other princesses of Ooo who previously accused her of not being a "real" princess. Lemongrab seems to have found true contentedness for the first time. He hires Jermaine to paint a mural on his bedroom ceiling. [S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</p>

<h3>Alternate timeline: The Defeat of the Lich</h3>
<p>Instead of stealing the Enchiridion and accessing the Time Room, the Lich attempts to use the Bag of Holding to end the world. He succeeds in sucking a lot of people into the bag, including Finn, Jake, Ice King, Lumpy Space Princess, Marceline, and the entire Candy Kingdom including Princess Bubblegum. Several of the candy people get amalgamated into "Desert Princess", who is capable of controlling sand with her mind. Finn and Jake manage to burrow out the bottom of the bag and by working together with everyone else they eventually defeat the Lich and defeat him once and for all by throwing him into the Sun. The giant crater is filled in with sand from inside the Bag of Holding. Due to these divergent changes from the main storyline, some events of the main comic series must occupy a separate timeline to the show. However, the comics still appear to follow the general story of the show. [<em>Free Comic Book Day 2012</em>, <em>Adventure Time #1</em> to <em>#4</em>]</p>

<h3>Sub-timeline: Robot Apocalypse</h3>
<p>Princess Bubblegum creates a time machine capable of transporting its user back to the moment at which it was first created, where the user will replace their past self. She destroys it after Jake misuses its power, so Jake gets Neptr to repair it. The repaired time machine transports a duplicate of Finn and Jake's minds fifteen years into the future, where they replace the minds of their future selves. Shortly after this, BMO accidentally creates two evil robots that begin to replicate themselves. [<em>Adventure Time #6</em> to <em>#7</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: This event takes place in 997 AMB when Finn was thirteen because Finn states that he is twenty eight after they travel forwards fifteen years.</p>
<p>By 1012 AMB, the robots are at war with the other inhabitants of Ooo. Finn, Jake and Bubblegum create a new time machine by vowing to spend the rest of their lives building a time machine and then sending it back to the point at which they made the vow. After a detour through the pilot episode and the events of <em>Adventure Time #1</em>, Finn and Jake travel back to the present, where they destroy the first robots and erase the timeline.

<p>BMO becomes infected by Randall N. Byron's virus after using the same technique to allow Finn, Jake, and Marceline to play <em>Super Guts Punch 3</em>. The virus gains independence from its creator, taking the name "Ewlbo" and infecting many of the robots of Ooo until eventually being defeated by Finn, Jake, and Marceline. [<em>Adventure Time #11</em> to <em>#14</em>]</p>
<p>Finn and Jake have several encounters with Magic Man over the course of the comics, where his mischievous schemes include stealing their voices, crashing Bubblegum's meeting with the Fancy Egg Folk, and stealing all the colour from the world. [<em>Adventure Time #15</em>, <em>#40</em>, and <em>#74</em>]</p>
<p>Ice King, along with Finn and Jake, re-discovers the dungeon he built with Hunson Abadeer and together they destroy the Echo of the Lich. [<em>Adventure Time #16</em> to <em>#19</em>]</p>
<p>The Gum, the creation which Bubblegum made just before the birth of Lemongrab, takes over the entire Candy Kingdom and must be defeated by Marceline, Bubblegum, and Lemongrab. [<em>Adventure Time #21</em> to <em>#24</em>]</p>
<p>Ricardio steals the Red and Blue Amulets from Princess Bubblegum and the Tree Fort and has to be defeated again by Finn, Jake, Marceline, and Bubblegum. They end up storing the amulets in a dungeon for safekeeping. [<em>Adventure Time #25</em>]</p>
<p>Things don't pan out well for Clarence and Ghost Princess in the afterlife. Clarence cheats on Ghost Princess with all the "smokin'-hot babe ghosts", who also constantly bully Ghost Princess, so she escapes the Fiftieth Dead World and returns to life. She decides to become a ghost hunter under the name "Anti-Ghost Princess".</p>

<h3>Sub-timeline: The Mnemonoid</h3>
<p>A creature named the Mnemonoid feeds on stories, which are its main source of food. It attacks the Tree Fort and begins stealing Finn's memories since they are an excellent source of stories. Finn continues to live normally, but at periodic points he suddenly forgets several years of his life. [<em>Adventure Time #31</em>]</p>
<p>In 1004 AMB, Finn suddenly forgets the previous five years of his life, and is suddenly five years older with no memory of the intervening time. This alternate future is completely inconsistent with the show; for example, the Gumball Guardians are still operational. By this point, Bubblegum and Marceline are the co-ruling queens of the so-called "Candy Vampire Kingdom". Small fights frequently break out between the Fire, Sand, Water, and Air kingdoms. The Mnemonoid shows up again and begins stealing more of Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #32</em>]</p>
<p>Finn suddenly wakes up in 1024 AMB, having forgotten the previous twenty years of his life. By this point, he is married to Phoebe the Flame Queen. The Sand Kingdom has annexed the Water and Air kingdoms and declared full-fledged war against the Fire Kingdom. The Mnemonoid attacks once again and kills Marceline by exposing her to direct sunlight, then begins stealing even more of Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #33</em>]</p>
<p>Finn forgets another thirty-five years of his life, finding himself in 1059 AMB. He travels completely alone, suggesting that most of his other companions have passed away by now. The world is frozen over, which could be the result of the crown grieving the loss of Ice King like it did in the Farmworld timeline. Bubblegum, depressed and alone without Marceline, lives in the frozen war-torn ruins of the Candy Kingdom. Luckily, Finn is able to remember the plans for the time machine from the robot apocalypse timeline. He travels back to the present day and is able to erase the timeline by making Mnemonoid be friends with LSP, an infinite source of gossip which is able to sustain him much more effectively than Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #34</em>]</p>
<hr>
<p>Before the King of Ooo's election and subsequent dethronement, the Candy Kingdom's secret service foils a plot by which he was planning to invade the Candy Kingdom with an army of bears. [<em>Adventure Time #41</em> to <em>#44</em>]</p>
<p>While exploring the basement underneath Joshua and Margaret Investigations, Finn and Jake accidentally break the statue of Gata. She suddenly comes back into existence as their long time friend and sister, as if she had never been erased, but Finn and Jake still can't remember who she is. She eventually sacrifices herself after realising that her continued presence could allow her evil mother to escape back into Ooo, and the world once again forgets she ever existed. [<em>Adventure Time #46</em> to <em>#49</em>]</p>
<p>Arklothac, the cosmic ruler of Candy, is summoned to Earth and successfully defeated by Finn and Jake using the Sword of Lun. They also defeat Ng'zot Aa, the cosmic ruler of slime, after he tries to infect BMO. [<em>Adventure Time #36</em> to <em>#39</em> and <em>#54</em> to <em>#57</em>]</p>
<p>Finn and Jake foil a plot by the leader of the 27th Dead World as well, who wanted to collect the youth from Ooo's inhabitants in order to craft an elixir and return to life. Finn and Jake end up with a large tub of the elixir. [<em>Adventure Time #51</em> to <em>#53</em>]</p>
<hr>
<img class="img-fluid" src="images/issue 60.png" alt="Issue 60">
<h3>Sub-timeline: The Cosmic Elementals</h3>
<p>Arklothac is released a second time and frees his compatriots, Zon the ruler of Fire and Ng'zot Aa the ruler of Slime. They can only be defeated by the Sword of Lun, but Finn is unable to use it a second time. He travels back in time to the Moon before the Mushroom War, in order to protect the sword and await its true bearer. Meanwhile in the future, Jake and Princess Bubblegum send the elixir of life through a portal back in time to make Finn immortal. Jake is slain by Arklothac just after this. Finn spends the next few years building a dungeon on the Moon to protect the Sword of Lun. Over a thousand years later, a future reincarnation of Finn named Penelope helps Finn defeat the Cosmic Elementals. They discover that she is the true bearer of the Sword of Lun, and the Cosmic Elementals are banished from existence. Finn is transported back to the present and forgets about the many hundreds of years he spent waiting on the Moon, and the timeline is erased. [<em>Adventure Time #58</em> to <em>#61</em>]</p>
<hr>
<p>As a result of the timeline shenanigans, Gata is released from her curse. The world doesn't remember who she is, but she is finally free. [<em>Adventure Time #61</em>]</p>
<p>Finn and Jake's remaining adventures within the comics are less grand in scope. They attend the Best Princess Ever competition, go on a balloon race, defeat a small army of their own clones, and attend the wedding of two characters named Casey and IBB.

<p><em>Bravest Warriors</em> has its own set of historical events, but unless it is confirmed to be a part of the <em>Adventure Time</em> continuity I will not include them in this timeline. The main evidence that the two shows are set in the same continuity is an image that was shown for a single frame during Chris' premonition in the episode <em>Ultra Wankershim</em>, which shows planet Earth with a large chunk missing, just like the Earth in <em>Adventure Time</em>. A popular fan theory is that Chris is descended from Finn, given their blond hair and similar personalities. It's also conceivable that the rest of the humans living on NeoMars are descended from the Islanders. However, this is all just speculation.</p>

<h3>Penelope</h3>
<p>A future reincarnation of Finn named Penelope travels the Land of Ooo as an adventurer much like him. She has a pet tigercorn named Betty (no affiliation to the other Betty) who is probably a future reincarnation of Jake. Like most reincarnations of Finn, she is missing her right arm and has a bionic replacement. [<em>Adventure Time #50</em> and <em>#61</em>]</p>
<p>She ends up having several interactions with individuals from the past. As well as helping Finn defeat the Cosmic Elementals as previously mentioned, she also discovers the Blue and Red Amulets in a chest in the dungeon built by Finn, Jake, Marceline, and Princess Bubblegum, and explores Princess Bubblegum's ruined library looking for help to fight the "awful offal abominations". She discovers Marceline's old zine as well as a couple of books written by Simon about his time as the Ice King. [<em>Adventure Time #25</em> and <em>#30</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: Penelope makes a cameo in a present day scene during <em>Adventure Time #75</em>, disguised in a trenchcoat. The explanation for this is unknown.</p>

<h3>BMO, the King of Ooo</h3>
<p>At some time in the future, BMO tells a group of children about the adventures of Finn and Jake. Marceline and Bubblegum listen in on the storytelling, and eventually fly off into the moonlight to find new adventures together.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Dude, I haven't thought about that day in forever! But I'm with the kid. I hate the ending. I think I just hate all endings. I mean, we're basically in an ending right now. Look around!

<p>BMO continues telling his stories for a thousand years to come. He takes the title "King of Ooo" (not to be confused with the other King of Ooo) and moves into a cabin at the top of Mount Cragdor, where he collects trinkets and memorabilia from Finn and Jake's life. People travel to come and listen to his stories, although as he gets older they become less and less reliable.</p>

<h3>A Thousand Years Later</h3>
<p>Time brings many changes to the Land of Ooo.</p>
<p>The original Candy Kingdom has expanded into a vast metropolis, but has since been abandoned. The great tree at its centre, which once sustained Neddy, has withered and died. Most of the candy people appear to be held in stasis on board the Prize Ball Guardian, an immense robotic replacement for the Gumball Guardians who were destroyed during the second coming of GOLB. The Hot Dog Kingdom has grown into a far larger kingdom that it used to be. A character named Pawn Swan roams the land selling his wares, much like Choose Goose did a thousand years before him. [S05E51 <em>Lemonhope Part Two</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>, <a href="http://wolfhard.tumblr.com/post/118388594601/graybles-1000-second-promo-tonight-coming-at"><em>Graybles 1000+</em> promo art</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wolfhard/status/1038082635795292161">Steve Wolfhard's Twitter</a>]</p>
<p>Some other characters from the time of the series are known to survive until this time. Ironically, Sweet P (formerly the Lich) grows up to be a great hero and inherits the Night Sword from Finn. The new form of Gunter continues to rule over the north of Ooo fused with Evergreen's crown as the Ice Thing. As previously mentioned, BMO survives thanks to the fact that he's a robot. The original King of Ooo is still alive. [S10E13 <em>Come Along With Me Part 1</em>, S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>, SDCC 2018: <em>Ble crew zine "Kings of Ooos"</em>]</p>
<p>Other characters do not get the opportunity to live forever. The Jiggler's casket and Mr. Fox's skull are seen in BMO's collection. Finn and Jermaine's gravestones are both seen, although intriguingly there doesn't appear to be one for Jake. It's possible that Jake lives much longer thanks to all the life essence he absorbed from his biological father. A monument to Finn is seen too, as well as a monument to either Jake or Jermaine. Simon is probably dead, given he was turned back into a normal human, although it's possible that Betty's wish to keep him safe extends his lifespan. [S10E13 <em>Come Along With Me Part 1</em>, S10E16 <em>Come Along With Me Part 4</em>]</p>
<p>The Earldom of Lemongrab also remains intact but abandoned. As promised, Lemonhope returns to it a thousand years after departing the Candy Kingdom to explore the world. Despite Finn and Jake's disappearance from the world, Lemonhope meets them while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point, and informs them that their legacy has survived. [S05E51 <em>Lemonhope Part Two</em>, <em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Finn and Jake! My peeps from a thousand years ago! Oh, yes. I have wandered ever since the liberation of the Earldom of Lemongrab. There is much wisdom to find out in the world, if one is humble. Alas, I have not visited those lands in many years. But stories of you two have spread far and wide. Legends of your deeds persist, long after you dudes have vanished.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Lemonhope [<em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>
</div>
<p>All five Elementals are confirmed to be present in the intro to the finale. Therefore, Princess Bubblegum or a future reincarnation of her is probably the unknown pink skinned individual seen behind bars in the Ice Thingdom. This means that the unknown individual holding the telescope could be Marceline, which is further evidenced by the symbol on the telescope which somewhat resembles her initials, "MA", and the fact that the individual rides the duck creature previously seen in Marceline's debut episode. Patience St Pim is still frozen in a ball of ice. Slime Princess and Flame Princess have died and been reincarnated into new forms, who are seen fighting each other. Lumpy Space Princess has also died and been reincarnated.

</div>
<p>The hybrid descendants of Jake and Lady Rainicorn become a dominant race known as "pups" due to how quickly they are able to breed and grow up. They build a city, possibly alongside the humans from the Islands, and reinvent advanced space travel, connecting Earth with other space-capable civilisations including the grey aliens. The pups appear to be ruled by Gibbon, the son of Charlie and one of Jake's grandchildren. Gibbon has obtained one of the jewels from the Ice Thing, which grants him immortality and pink ice powers. Incidentally, it is the same gem as the one which was in Turtle Princess' "wedding ring". In addition, Gibbon learns the power to "extinguish" other pups' powers. Most pups are extinguished of their powers at birth.

<h3>Shermy and Beth</h3>
<p>Two adventurers travel the Land of Ooo. They are named Shermy and Beth, and they could be future reincarnations of Finn and Jake. They live in Marceline's old cave house, just like how Finn and Jake lived in Marceline's old Tree Fort. Beth is the pup princess, one of the descendants of Jake and Lady Rainicorn. Another of their friends is Princess Zip, a grey alien who wears a crown just like Princess Bubblegum's, although there seem to be several such crowns in the future; BMO alone owns at least four of them. [S10E13 <em>Come Along With Me Part 1</em>]</p>
<p>Beth, whose former full title is Princess Betony Burrito Jakson IV, runs away from her kingdom to avoid having her powers extinguished by Gibbon, and remains a fugitive. This explains why she and Shermy live in Marceline's hidden-away cave, and also explains why a pup is seen spying on their house. [Steve Wolfhard's Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm_Z1eahj4d/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnB9SU9hlHC/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnEsB-VBvsw/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnHCR83hvBw/">4</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnJtlfshWsL/">5</a>)]</p>
<p>One day, Shermy and Beth discover a mysterious object scuffed up by the feet of the Prize Ball Guardian. They decide to bring it to the legendary King of Ooo, BMO, at the top of Mount Cragdor, who identifies it as Finn's bionic arm which was bitten off by GOLB a thousand years prior. BMO goes on to tell Shermy and Beth the story of the Great Gum War and the second coming of GOLB. [S10E13 <em>Come Along With Me Part 1</em>]</p>

<h3>The Graybles</h3>
<p>On a planet far from Earth, a baby alien called Cuber gets lost in a cave and is threatened by a vicious dog-like creature. He is rescued by his sister Tuber. [S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<p class="note">Note: <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em> and the graphic novel <em>Graybles Schmaybles</em> suggest that Cuber was alive during the events of the series. This is probably false.</p>
<p>Some of the past events of Ooo become preserved as short stories known as graybles, which are used by Cuber later in his life for entertainment and utility. [S04E02 <em>Five Short Graybles</em>, S05E03 <em>Five More Short Graybles</em>, S05E24 <em>Another Five More Short Graybles</em>, <em>Finn & Jake Investigations</em>]</p>
<p>After accidentally killing the bride of a space wedding between two pups, Cuber is attacked by several of their vessels. Fearing for his life, he flees from his spaceship in an escape pod and crash lands on the surface of Earth near the former Candy Kingdom. While on the run he accidentally destroys the Prize Ball Guardian which was carrying all the candy people, possibly ending Princess Bubblegum's legacy for good. He steals one of his assailant's ships, and is able to climb back into space and safely return to his own ship, apparently unaware of how much he had just destroyed. [S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<p>Cuber briefly meets Finn and Jake while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point, and recognises them as the protagonists of his graybles. From their perspective, he is the first person they meet. But from a chronological perspective, he is the last. [<em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>

<h3>Empress Marceline</h3>
<p class="note">Note: Even though this arc officially takes place a thousand years in the future, it was intended by the writers to take place ten thousand years in the future to avoid conflicting with the finale's future. It was changed by a revisionist at Cartoon Network, likely due to a misunderstanding about the writers' intentions.</p>

  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline speaking to Finn and Jake [<em>Season 11 #1</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>By this time, Marceline has taken on the title of "Empress" and rules alongside Princess Bubblegum. After BMO breaks down, Bubblegum leaves the castle for a couple of centuries to search for a patch to repair them, leaving Marceline on her own. [<em>Season 11 #4</em>]</p>
<p>Hunson Abadeer, who misses his daughter, sees an opportunity to trick her into returning to the Nightosphere. He believes that if he is able to erase enough of her memories of Ooo, she will eventually have nowhere else to go. So he employs three memory-stealing creatures to disguise themselves as her faithful robotic servants known as "The Three" and begin siphoning off her memories. She forgets about many of her closest friends, most notably Princess Bubblegum, but she still does not wish to return to the Nightosphere. Hunson Abadeer takes more and more drastic action to uncover and remove Marceline's memories, like trying to trigger them via the discovery of old artifacts. Eventually he summons versions of Princess Bubblegum, Marceline, and Simon from the past to see if they uncover more memories. However, the plan backfires and the individuals from the past defeat The Three. [<em>Season 11 #1</em> to <em>#4</em>]</p>
<p>Princess Bubblegum returns with the patch for BMO, and the others return to the past where they belong. [<em>Season 11 #4</em>]</p>
