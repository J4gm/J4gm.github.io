<p>This is not a definitive list of every Bubbline moment, but it's enough to give you a good idea of why many people consider this relationship to be canon.</p>
<hr>
<p>In March 2011, <em>Go With Me</em> aired and was the first episode to feature interaction between Marceline and Bubblegum. In the episode, Marceline deliberately messes up Finn's chances of going on a date with Bubblegum even though Marceline is shown to have no interest in Finn.</p>
<p>In May 2011, Natasha Allegri, a storyboard artist on the show, began drawing Bubbline art. [<a href="http://natazilla.tumblr.com/post/5680916215">One example</a>]</p>
<p>In September 2011, <em>What Was Missing</em> aired and massively expanded on Marceline and Bubblegum's relationship. It introduces Bubblegum's rock t-shirt and implies a past romantic relationship and break-up via the song <em>I'm Just Your Problem</em>. Bubbline shipping exploded within the fanbase after this episode.</p>
<p>A few days later, Frederator studios (the co-producers of <em>Adventure Time</em>) put out an episode recap for their <em>Mathematical!</em> series for the episode <em>What Was Missing</em>. The script for the video outright stated the idea that Bubblegum and Marceline were lovers. After some messy controversy, <em>Mathematical!</em> was cancelled and its producer was fired from the company. It is important to realise that the depiction of a homosexual relationship was not the only thing "wrong" with the video, and was not the only reason for the controversy. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G55ZV91TY8">The <em>Mathematical!</em> video (re-uploaded by an unofficial source)</a>, <a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Mathematical!">Further information</a>]</p>
<p>In July 2013, <em>Sky Witch</em> aired and contained several more suggestive interactions between Marceline and Bubblegum, including a scene where Bubblegum is shown deeply sniffing the shirt Marceline gave her. It reveals that the shirt has more sentimental value to Bubblegum than Hambo does to Marceline.</p>
<p>At a book signing in mid 2014, Olivia Olson, who is Marceline's voice actress, claimed that Pendleton Ward told her that Marceline and Bubblegum used to date. She later tweeted, "I like to make things up at panels. Ya'll take my stories way too seriously...", but that tweet has since been deleted. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EleCNWfwTY">Video of the reveal</a>, <a href="https://redd.it/2d0ees">Reddit discussion of the redaction</a>]</p>
<p>In September 2014, issue 32 featured a version of the future where Marceline and Bubblegum became the co-ruling queens of the Candy Kingdom, although their relationship at this time is not explicitly romantic. In issue 34, future Bubblegum tells each of their younger versions a secret about the future. They are redacted from the user and printed as "lllllllll lllll lllll lll" and "l llll lll lllllllll". Using the context of their replies and by counting the spaces and characters, the fanbase has theorised that these actually read "Marceline still loves you" and "I love you Marceline".</p>
<p>In the first half of 2015, the comic series <em>Marceline Gone Adrift</em> featured several close embraces between the two and explored their past in a lot more depth.</p>
<p>In November 2015, <em>Varmints</em> aired. It expanded on their past relationship and featured <em>a lot</em> of blushing.</p>
<p>Later that month, the <em>Stakes</em> miniseries aired. Once again, it featured many more suggestive moments and quotes, including a kiss on the head during Marceline's dream sequence.</p>
<p>In December 2015, issue 47 of the main comic series featured a page where Marceline hastily kills a thought-demon while it relays her thoughts about Bubblegum, and looks embarrassed afterwards.</p>
<p>In March 2016, <em>Broke His Crown</em> aired. Marceline invites Bubblegum to dinner at the Ice Kingdom, and Bubblegum calls Marceline "girlfriend".</p>
<p>Most recently, the pair were seen holding hands in <em>Seventeen</em> and Finn mentions his confusion concerning their relationship in <em>Marcy and Hunson</em>. Both of those episodes aired in December 2017.</p>
