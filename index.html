<p>First things first, this post is <strong>really long</strong>. If you don't want to read it all right now, I recommend bookmarking it so you can come back to it later. This was originally going to be a Reddit text post, but it quickly exceeded the forty thousand character limit and now stands at about six times that amount, which is why I've moved it to a separate site. This also means I can continue to update the timeline for as long as new <em>Adventure Time</em> content is being released.</p>
<p>Secondly, this timeline contains <strong>all the spoilers</strong>, up to and including <em>Come Along With Me</em>, the finale. Please don't read it unless you've finished the show and you've read all the comics you intend to read. I also recommend you read <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, since a lot of the timeline draws from that.</p>
<p>I am from the UK, so one must pardon any British spelling or grammar.</p>
<p>Please leave your thoughts and criticisms in the comments section at the bottom of the page, and keep it civil. If you would like to message me privately, send a PM to one of my social media accounts, linked at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="images/thank you.png" alt="Thank You">
<h3 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h3>
<p>This post was inspired by several <em>Adventure Time</em> timelines published before it. The main reason I started this project was because <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/IpzJZ">the timeline by RedLionKing</a> has become outdated and only deals with the core storyline, although my version isn't anywhere near as beautifully written so I recommend you check it out anyway. Also credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/66ku1x/complete_adventure_time_timeline_spoilers/">this concise timeline by Viernes de Siluetas</a>, from whom I stole the date system.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/uncivilizedelk">Uncivilized Elk</a> for his in-depth episode analysis videos which have inspired some details of the timeline, and thanks to all the editors and transcribers on the <a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki"><em>Adventure Time</em> Wiki</a> without whom this task would have been a lot more arduous.</p>
<p>Lots of credit to <a href="https://spiderciderko.tumblr.com/">SpiderCider</a> and <a href="https://already-19.tumblr.com/">DÃ©cadent</a> for painstakingly translating this entire piece into Korean. That's linked at the top of the page, although it's a bit out of date now. If anyone is interested in providing translations for any other languages, drop me a PM.</p>
<p>And of course, thanks to Pendleton Ward and the entire <em>Adventure Time</em> crew for creating one of the most deep, complex, and inspiring worlds in the history of children's television.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<p>This timeline is designed to be as complete as possible. This means that not only am I drawing events from the show, but also from many other pieces of officially licensed material, including comics, video games, and graphic novels.</p>
<p>One question that gets thrown around a lot is "Are the comics canon?" The short answer is no. <a href="https://twitter.com/UncivilizedElk/status/1034295557051695104">Adam Muto</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPendarvis/status/1028301567294889985">Jack Pendarvis</a> have both clearly stated that they are not. However, the comics are officially licensed, and many of them fit very neatly into the lore of the show. In fact, the only comics which are dramatically irreconcilable with the show are the Bag of Holding arc, in which Finn and Jake throw the Lich into the Sun, and the <em>Seeing Red</em> graphic novel, which contains a multitude of inaccuracies regarding Marceline's past. Other than that, there are only minor plot holes to overlook. Therefore, I'm going to treat the comics like an alternate timeline, which leaves me free to selectively choose which elements I include in the main timeline.</p>
<p><a href="media">Click here</a> for a list of every single piece of media which has been considered for the timeline. I have also considered things like promotional art and social media posts from members of the show's crew, although these are often tongue-in-cheek and shouldn't be taken as canon in every instance. Storyboards and other production material might also be sourced, but only for clarification; cut scenes do not count. Scrapped episodes also do not count.</p>
<p>Whenever I make a statement or pull a quote from somewhere, I will show the source in square brackets [like this]. That way, you can make up your own mind whether or not you choose to believe a certain element is canon.</p>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Adventure_Time_episodes#Episodes">official season arrangement</a> for labelling episodes, which is the arrangement composed of ten seasons used by Cartoon Network and Wikipedia but not the one used by the fan wiki and some members of the crew. For example, <em>Elemental</em> is S08E08 rather than S07E34. This doesn't affect the order of individual episodes in any way, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
<hr>

<img class="img-fluid" src="images/high strangeness.png" alt="High Strangeness">
<h3 id="date-system">Date system</h3>
<p>All dates are organised around a year zero, which is the year of the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb and the impact of the Catalyst Comet. BMB stands for Before Mushroom Bomb and AMB stands for After Mushroom Bomb. The letter c before a date stands for circa, and indicates that this is an estimated date. The letter X is used to denote any digit (e.g. 99X could be any year from 990 to 999). A corresponding real-life date is displayed in brackets. Since the beginnings and ends of years are not clear, many events may be one year off. Where applicable, the New Year is assumed to be Finn's birthday.</p>
<p>For labelling things with a real-life date, I have assumed that <strong>0&nbsp;AMB&nbsp;=&nbsp;2010&nbsp;CE</strong>. See the section on the Great Mushroom War for evidence supporting this date.</p>
<p>The Mushroom Bomb and the war-time Catalyst Comet hit at approximately the same time. Uniting these two pivotal events makes it much easier to put a date to things, so I have assumed that they both take place in 0 AMB.</p>

<h3>The Beginning of the Multiverse</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Before there was time&nbsp;- before there was anything&nbsp;- there was nothing. And before there was nothing, there were monsters.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Lich [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Reality exists as an infinite chaotic sea of monsters, including beings like Orgalorg, GOLB, and possibly the Lich. By incomprehensible chance, the monsters eventually come to a common agreement on the state of reality, and this consensus becomes the Multiverse. Therefore, despite its appearance to those who inhabit it, the Multiverse is not actually material. The Multiverse is an emergent product of consciousness rather than consciousness being an emergent product of the Multiverse. Every sentient being that lives in the Multiverse paradoxically maintains its existence by experiencing it, and this also means that every sentient being has an existence beyond the material, known as their soul.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Third Orb does not exist, said the Sage.<br>
  <font color="steelblue">Why? asked the Student.</font><br>
  Because the Multiverse, said the Sage, within which Third Orb exists, does not exist. The Multiverse is a Consensus Reality shared by the Minds of all Sentient Beings. If they were to Die, the Multiverse, as such, would suddenly blink out of existence, vanish, be no more.<br>
  <font color="steelblue">Why? asked the Student.</font><br>
  Because, said the Sage, there would be no one to Perceive It.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Other than this, the origins of the Multiverse are largely unknown. Nobody knows where the monsters came from or what the true nature of reality is. Everything we know about the world before existence comes from that single glimpse granted by the Lich.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Where did the Multiverse come from? Since logic dictates that asking this question must result in an infinite regression â€” What created the Multiverse? And what created the Thing that created the Multiverse? Etcetera â€” this suggests that the mental engine of logical thinking is not designed to determine the Answer.</p>

<h3 id="the-structure-of-existence">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Structure of Existence</h3>
<p>The Multiverse imagined by the primordial monsters is composed of a vast (perhaps infinite) number of "dimensions" which each hold a universe. One of these is the Earth Dimension, which contains the planet Earth (sometimes referred to as "Third Orb") as well as all the other planets, stars, and galaxies in our own universe. Other dimensions include the Astral Plane, the Crystal Dimension, Lumpy Space, the Nightosphere, the Citadel, and many more. Amidst this complex system of dimensions is the Time Room:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>At the centre of the Multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming wormholes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronisation allowing for the safe passage of particles through a non-local region of space-time.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Booko [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The physics behind the concept of the Multiverse is somewhat explained in chapter four of the Wizards' Enchiridion, albeit in a very hand-wavy pseudo-scientific way. To prevent all of the dimensions from catastrophically colliding with one another, all particles in a specific dimension have their own unique "frequency". Particles with different frequencies reside in different dimensions. Adjusting this frequency allows for interdimensional travel. Another property of each dimension is its "elasticity", which determines how easy it is to change the frequency of particles within that dimension. As stated above by Booko, dimensions can be interlinked if the frequencies of the particles in a local region of both dimensions can be somehow synchronised, hence forming a kind of gateway called a "portal". This is easier in more elastic dimensions. A very rudimentary form of temporal synchronisation is demonstrated by Finn when he interacts with the little people, who reside in "a different dimensional plane" according to Jake. Finn shakes the little people, which synchronises their frequencies enough to allow for brief interdimensional communication. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S05E05 <em>All the Little People</em>]</p>
<p>The elasticity of a dimension has other effects besides ease of interdimensional travel. For example, highly elastic dimensions are more easily influenced by magic (more on that in a couple of sections), and are more likely to allow for interspecies hybrids to be born. The most extreme known examples of hybrids seen in the show are Jake's descendants, who contain genes from at least four species; bears, rainicorns, dogs, and shape-shifters. The elasticity of a dimension can vary with time. Earth was elastic in the time of the dinosaurs, then became very rigid during modern times, then elastic once again following the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb. [S06E12 <em>Ocarina</em>, S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>One final principle of the Multiverse is the concept of "Amok Time", which states that causality can sometimes be reversed. This allows for accurate predictions of the future and the occasional bit of time travel. At the very beginning of time there is a place called the Vanishing Point, and anyone who gets trapped there will be erased from history. Jake the Dog claims to have seen the Big Bang while travelling back in time to visit the Vanishing Point. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, <em>Beginning of the End #3</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: A slightly more scientifically rooted explanation for the structure of the Multiverse is alluded to in storyboard panels from <em>Crossover</em>. The panels cite a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~alinde/1032226.pdf">1994 <em>Scientific American</em> article</a> by physicist Andrei Linde which talks about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation">eternal inflation model</a>. However, this model has never been explicitly referenced in the show and is pretty much irreconcilable with the other model.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that time travel is handled quite differently in the comics compared to the show. In the comics it is a frequently used plot device, with instances of time travel happening in several arcs including the Time Machine arc, <em>Banana Guard Academy</em>, the Cosmic Elementals arc, <em>Beginning of the End</em>, and the first arc of <em>Season 11</em>. On the other hand, the only real instance of time travel which occurs in the show is Betty travelling into the future. Princess Bubblegum even makes it clear that she is not able to produce a "real" time machine in <em>Bad Timing</em>.</p></font>

<h3 id="the-cosmic-entities">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Cosmic Entities</h3>
<p>Prismo, who was briefly mentioned earlier, is one of the many god-like "Cosmic Entities" who inhabit the Multiverse and make up the pantheon of <em>Adventure Time</em>. Most of them have a specific purpose within the elaborate clockwork of existence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prismo is a Wish Master and the keeper of the Time Room, capable of granting one wish to anyone who succeeds in visiting him. He is kept alive by the dreams of an old man, and later by the dreams of Jake the Dog. [S06E01 <em>Wake Up</em>]</li>
  <li>The Cosmic Owl monitors the dreams of every being in the Multiverse and chooses which ones will come true. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl are therefore invariably prophetic, although these dreams are often metaphorical rather than literal. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl in which the dreamer sees their own death are known as "croak dreams". [S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>, S06E36 <em>Hoots</em>]</li>
  <li>Death governs the fifty Dead Worlds, where the souls of the inhabitants of the Multiverse go after they die. He lives in a castle of light in the Land of the Dead. [S02E17 <em>Death in Bloom</em>, S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>]</li>
  <li>The Catalyst Comet delivers great change to Earth every thousand years. More on that later. [S06E25 <em>Astral Plane</em>]</li>
  <li>GOLB is the embodiment of chaos and discord. When he consumes people, they are reset to their primal state and eventually removed from existence in such a way that not even wish magic can bring them back. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>, S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</li>
  <li>Many of the other monsters from before time likely exist as Cosmic Entities, including Orgalorg. [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It can sometimes be unclear who is and is not a Cosmic Entity. In addition to those above, the fan wiki lists Grob Gob Glob Grod, Party God, Cuber, Life, the Elementals, Finn, Martin, and the Lich as Cosmic Entities. A deity named Malus, who bears a striking resemblance to the real life pagan deity Abraxas, is also seen in one of Simon's books on GOLB. [<a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Deities_and_Cosmic_Entities">Wiki: Category:Deities and Cosmic Entities</a>, S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>
<p>Prismo apparently has a "boss" whose identity is unknown. [S07E23 <em>Crossover</em>]</p>

<h3 id="the-concept-of-death">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Concept of Death</h3>
<p><em>Adventure Time</em> has done a surprising amount of exploration around what might happen after you die. There appear to be four main possibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You could be reincarnated as a new being. This might only apply to Elementals and Agents of Change (more on these later). [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</li>
  <li>You could become a ghost, a soul without a material counterpart, and continue to roam the mortal plane. This normally happens when you have "unfinished business". [S06E17 <em>Ghost Fly</em>]</li>
  <li>You could become a demon, a physical manifestation of a ghost, and live in the Nightosphere. [<em>Adventure Time #53</em>]</li>
  <li>You could be transported to one of the fifty Dead Worlds based on the good and bad things you've done during your life and the way in which you died. It is not clear whether the Dead Worlds are actual dimensions or a separate kind of thing. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, <em>Adventure Time #53</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It is implied that ending up in a higher Dead World is a more desirable outcome. The highest ever mentioned in the show is the Fiftieth, which appears to be the equivalent of Heaven and is probably synonymous with "Glob World". [S03E24 <em>Ghost Princess</em>, S05E21 <em>The Suitor</em>, S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>]</p>
<p>According to Jake, lower Dead Worlds are the worlds containing ghosts, which overlap with the material world. [S06E17 <em>Ghost Fly</em>]</p>

<h3 id="the-concept-of-magic">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Concept of Magic</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>What is the Origin of Wizardry? Pour yourself a cold glass of lemonade, sit in a comfy chair, kick your shoes off, lean back, close your eyes, and think. If reality is Mental in nature, analogous to a Cosmic Mind, and if Wizardry is a function of the Imagination, then the Forces of Nature in the Multiverse are akin to the Currents of the Cosmic Imagination. Thus, the Origin of Wizardry is at the Core of Creation, and Wizards can create or destroy as they wish, tapping into the Power of the Cosmic Imagination.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Since the Multiverse is maintained by the perceptions of the sentient beings within it, the imagination can actually be used to change the very structure of existence. This practice is most commonly known as "magic" and used almost exclusively by witches and wizards, although others can also learn to manipulate the material world using their mind.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>However insecure a wizard might be, wizardry is the realm of the Imagination, and even the flabbiest, most flop-sweaty wizard can warp your perceptions enough to make you believe they are fully capable of kicking your butt.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Chapter Two of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Magic most commonly manifests itself in the form of spell-casting, in which magic users recite incantations and channel their imagination through magically charged items in order to produce various effects. They usually have to practice one trick over and over until they are able to consistently perform it, which is why most magic users have a unique but limited arsenal of spells. There are other methods of performing magic as well. For example, Finn has performed magic via meditation and song, and Son of Rap Bear can produce explosions by rapping. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S03E07 <em>Still</em>, S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>, S10E03 <em>Son of Rap Bear</em>]</p>
<p>According to Betty Grof's MMS theory, all magic users have varying levels of magic, madness, and sadness. These three properties are required in order to reliably perform magic. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>]</p>
<p>There are two perspectives on the concept of magic. Scientists like Princess Bubblegum believe that it happens due to observational quantum effects and is grounded in scientific principles. On the other hand, magicians choose not to question the methods by which magic is possible, and, thanks to this blind belief, they are far more proficient at performing it. Neither view is incorrect.

<h3 id="the-infinite-enchiridion">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<h3>The Infinite Enchiridion</h3>
<p>The Enchiridion is an ancient tome and one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the Multiverse. Its exact origin is unknown, but the author is implied to be the reader. Over the course of all of history, it is written and enchanted by thousands of wizards. These spells cause it to gain sentience, change with every reading, automatically translate into the reader's native language, and contain knowledge from the past and future. The original tome is over eight million pages long. Various abridged copies are eventually produced, all of which retain its magical properties. The tome is split into two books: one for heroes and one for wizards. It teaches heroes how to conduct themselves and best serve their wizard masters, and it teaches wizards how to perform many ancient and secret forms of magic. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Every ten thousand years, the Enchiridion transports its original author to the Time Room, where they must make a choice. They can either force the Multiverse to reset to how it was ten thousand years ago, or they can allow it to continue into the unknown. The author almost always chooses to have it reset.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Since we've done this thousands of times, you may feel this Universe has been played out, so to speak. Every other time, you've decided to go back in time and start over, to that moment in the quarry when you were carving your name and your true love's name into the side of the boulder, when you first conceived of writing The Enchiridion. You were the young Wizard who wrote it, but you've forgotten. When I become sentient enough to tell you, after ten thousand years, I remind you and ask you if you'd like to end it all and let the Unknown occur, or if you'd like to go back again and experience another variation of the last ten thousand years. The Multiverse is unstoppable. Even if it ends, it will sprout back into existence again, but this time in some new, unknown way. Just as it did when all of This began. I'm just asking. It's your decision.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>It is somewhat unclear how this cycle fits into the rest of the history of the Multiverse.</p>
<p>Placing gems into various slots in the Enchiridion can produce powerful magic spells. Most notably, filling the gem slots in the front cover enables the user to open a portal to any dimension in the Multiverse, and might even allow for time travel.

<h3>The Formation of the Solar System</h3>
<p>The planets Earth and Mars form in the Earth Dimension around a sentient star called the Sun. [S06E10 <em>Something Big</em>]</p>
<p>On Planet Earth exists the concept of five fundamental elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, Slime, and Lumps: parodying the real-life (but false) classical elements of fire, water, earth, air, and aether. These will become important later on. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>, S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
<p>A demon named Hunson Abadeer comes into being around this time:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>My single earliest memory occurred eons before the Mushroom War. This memory consists of one image: me eating a ham sandwich, perched atop Rock Candy Mountain, overlooking the Sea of Something, long before Plants, Animals, and Actual Things came into existence in the Land of Ooo, surrounded by an all-encompassing Night of Nothingness. Full disclosure: I believe I was a ghost at the time, although it isn't clear how a ghost can sit on a mountain peak or eat a ham sandwich.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Hunson Abadeer, in the Encyclopaedia [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
</div>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: This excerpt suggests that the Land of Ooo has existed since the beginning of life on Earth, but this is now known to be false since it did not form until after the Great Mushroom War.</p></font>
<p>It is not known if Hunson Abadeer was once a living being, or if his soul simply came into existence out of nothing. Even he admits to not knowing his own origin. Once he manifests a physical demon body, he and most other demons end up living in a hellish dimension called the Nightosphere. He claims that he was a carny boss in his youth, going by the name Johnny Corndog. [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>Season 11 #2</em>]</p>

<h3>Other Worlds</h3>
<p>Aside from Earth, a multitude of other planets in and around the Solar System are also inhabitable. Eventually, interplanetary travel becomes widespread enough that many of them are able to communicate with one another, forming the backbone of an interstellar community. As far as we know, Earth never makes contact with its neighbours. [S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</p>
<p>Currently, these are the other worlds within the Earth Dimension where life is known to exist:</p>

<h3>The Cosmic Elementals</h3>
<p>Four Cosmic Entities each rule over one of the four elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zon inhabits the Sun and rules the element of Fire.</li>
  <li>Lun inhabits the Moon and rules the element of Ice.</li>
  <li>Arklothac rules the element of Candy.</li>

<p>Zon, Arklothac, and Ng'zot Aa reap the Earth for many years, terrorising the fledgling life that has begun to appear. Lun takes pity on the inhabitants of Earth and decides to take action against the other Elementals. She betrays them and has them locked outside the Earth Dimension so that they can do no further harm. [<em>Adventure Time #59</em>]</p>
<p>To prevent the evil Elementals from ever returning, Lun sacrifices herself to create the Sword of Lun, a weapon capable of destroying them. Before being used, the sword must await its true bearer, "a warrior who can withstand great bodily loss without injury". [<em>Adventure Time #61</em>]</p>

<h3>The Earthly Elementals</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Ever since life began on this planet, there have always been embodiments of the four elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime. Across eons and millennia the four Elementals lived, and died, and lived again.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Patience St Pim [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The Elementals are powerful wizards who live on Earth and each represent one of the aforementioned elements. They possess the power to generate and shape their own element in a variety of ways. Whenever an Elemental dies, their soul is reincarnated into a new body, meaning that there is almost always a living representative for each element at any one time. The Elementals can occasionally make contact with their past lives. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E19 <em>Jelly Beans Have Power</em>]</p>
<p>The fifth element, Lumps, behaves as an "anti-element", and also has an associated Elemental to go with it. The Lumps Elemental is capable of undoing the magic of the other four, as well as some other types of transfiguration magic. Furthermore, Lumps apparently permeates through the universe, similar to aether, its classical counterpart. A Lumpy Space person is seen on the planet of the koala people, suggesting that Lumpy Space is accessible from anywhere in the universe. [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Lumps are the subspace molecular lattice that binds together the scientific and magical forces of Ooo. More powerful than any one element, it's the force that orders reality into its true shape.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Lumpy Space Queen [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Like all magic users, the power of the Elementals is entirely dependent on the elasticity of the Earth Dimension. For example, Evergreen, who lived millions of years in the past, is capable of constructing an entire castle from ice, whereas the fire elemental of the pre-war era struggles to heat a single cup of coffee. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>

<h3>Evergreen's Crown and the Green Catalyst Comet</h3>
<p>During the time of the dinosaurs, the four Elementals are Urgence Evergreen (Ice), Balthus (Fire), Chatsberry (Candy) and Slimy D (Slime). The Lumps Elemental of this time is never mentioned. Evergreen the Ice Elemental has a mutated dinosaur servant named Gunther, who vainly hopes to eventually become his master's magical apprentice. Gunther briefly meets Finn and Jake while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, <em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>
<p>Evergreen spots the impending Green Catalyst Comet and notices that it is far more powerful than those that have come before it. It carries so much power that it would wipe out most of the life on the planet, so Evergreen seeks a way to stop it. He uses his knowledge of technology and magic to construct a golden crown capable of granting its wearer their greatest wish, but it needs a power source: the ruby eyes of the lava dog Magwood. To help battle Magwood and retrieve the eyes, Evergreen summons the other three Elementals to his castle from their respective realms. They reject his plan, stating that wish magic is too dangerous and reminding him that even if they die, they will be reincarnated:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Hath not a Comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness? If this Comet hits, we four indeed may perish, but the elements we embody&nbsp;- Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime&nbsp;- will live on.

  <p class="quotesrc">Balthus [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>]</p>

<p>Ignoring their advice, Evergreen has them frozen and sets off to take on Magwood alone. His mission is successful and he retrieves the eyes before rushing them back to his castle and completing the crown. However, just as he is about to use it to vanquish the Comet, he is attacked by Magwood, who begins to knock down sections of the castle in its blind rage. Evergreen becomes trapped under debris and is unable to put on the crown and wish for the Comet's destruction, so he instead orders his dinosaur servant Gunther to do it. But Gunther's greatest desire is not to destroy the Comet.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Instead of stopping the Comet, Gunther's truest, deepest wish came true. His nose lengthened, white hair grew from his head, and a beard descended from his face as the crown changed Gunther into Evergreen. Snow began swirling within the room. Evergreen was horrified.

<h3>The First Coming of GOLB and the Death of Margles</h3>
<p>Earth is not the only place in the Solar System harbouring life. At some point, a utopian society emerges on Mars. It is not clear where they came from, but it has been theorised that they are advanced humans who became somehow transported back in time. This theory is supported by the following facts: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Their king is Abraham Lincoln, a human from the future. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>]</li>
  <li>Moe was involved in the design of the Martian colony, as seen in blueprints while his memory is playing. [S07E14-15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know</em>]</li>

</ul>
<p>Lincoln's champion is the four-faced Grob Gob Glob Grod, who later becomes entwined in the religious beliefs of the inhabitants of Earth. GGGG has a brother named Magic Man, and Magic Man has a wife named Margles.</p>
<p>Mars is attacked by GOLB, who consumes Margles and completely removes her from existence. To prevent his second coming, Magic Man builds a defence system called the Magical Automated Resistance Generating Laser Energy Supplier (M.A.R.G.L.E.S.) in the image of his late wife, and plans to install it on the peak of Olympus Mons.</p>

<h3>The Further Adventures of Orgalorg</h3>
<p>Sometime around the dawn of the twentieth century, the penguin form of Orgalorg opens a drinks manufacturing company called "Gunto's" and becomes fairly wealthy thanks to its success. He owns a car (closely resembling a Ford Model T) and probably still lives in Britain. It seems unlikely that an immortal penguin god would be able to adapt and blend in so well with modern society, but somehow Orgalorg manages to do so without raising too many eyebrows. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: Orgalorg has not yet been renamed Gunter at this point, so the similar name of the company must be a coincidence.</p></font>
<p>During the First World War, he becomes a fighter pilot for the British Royal Air Force and flies a biplane resembling a Sopwith Camel, which entered service in 1917 CE (93 BMB). It is unknown whether or not Orgalorg has any involvement in the Second World War, but at some point he becomes a movie director. By the seventies, he has moved to the United States where he joins the counter-cultural movement. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>

<h3>The Birth of Simon Petrikov</h3>

<h3>The Birth of Patience St Pim, the Ice Elemental</h3>
<p>After the death of an unknown previous Elemental, the spirit of the Ice Elemental is reborn as Patience St Pim. She and the other Elementals of the modern generation discover their powers and eventually find one another, although their powers are weak due to the rigidity of the Earth Dimension at this time.

<p>By this time, Patience is already making plans for an "elemental purification spell" which she plans to use to re-establish the four elemental realms.

<h3 id="the-human-space-age">XX BMB (19XX CE)</h3>
<h3>The Human Space Age</h3>
<p>Despite his comfortable integration into human society, Orgalorg somehow realises that he is something more than just an immortal penguin. Since it was the gravity of the planet Earth which compressed him into his current weak form, he recognises that he must attempt to escape into space so that he can take his true form. Meanwhile, a man named Davey Johnson works a desk job at a space agency and is a previous life of Finn Mertens. He is offered the chance to go to space but declines, and thanks to this decision he spots Orgalorg trying to steal the rocket and has him apprehended. [<em>Adventure Time #50</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: Davey was alive before the war, meaning that if the Blue Comet struck at the same time as the war then Davey was actually a previous life of the Blue Comet rather than a future reincarnation of it. This suggests that the Catalyst Comet is not the "original" progenitor of the Agents of Change, so the existence of Davey should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. See "The Blue Catalyst Comet" for more discussion about the placement of that comet.</p></font>

<h3>Simon and Betty</h3>
<p>Magic has mostly died out by modern times, with the great heroes and wizards of old becoming nothing but myths and legends. However, there still seems to be a vague awareness of the existence of magic and it is suggested that a number of people still believe in it:</p>
<div class="quote">

  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof are both post-graduate antiquarians studying ancient artifacts and their relation to magic at the University of Petrograd in Russia. They meet each other just before Betty was due to leave on a six month trip to study petroglyphs in the Australian outback. She cancels the trip and becomes almost obsessed with Simon. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S10E11 <em>Temple of Mars</em>]</p>

</div>
<p>Betty eventually becomes Simon's fiancÃ©e and they co-author a book called <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>. Simon's research into the arcane leads him to discover the existence of GOLB, but he is  hospitalised after Betty tries to throw him a jar of cherries and he doesn't get any further research done on the subject. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>

<p>Following that, Simon discovers two major artifacts on his expeditions which challenge his previously sceptical perspective on magic. The first is Evergreen's crown, which he purchases from an old dockworker in Northern Scandinavia. The second artifact is a copy of the Enchiridion, which he discovers with help from Betty. [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>On my recent expedition to Islamabad, in a secret vault in the Hindu Kush Mountains, I discovered an incredible artifact&nbsp;- an ancient book known as "The Enchiridion".

  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his letter to Betty [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>After returning home from these expeditions, he presents his findings at the Museum of History, but the discoveries receive little recognition. A journalist named Bruce Guese writes a demeaning article, pictured above. [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>, <a href="http://archive.is/Iyq3l">Transcript of above image</a>]</p>
<p>Simon returns to Betty and shows her the crown, putting it on his head as a joke. Suddenly, his head is filled with "secrets of the ice and snow" as the crown continues to fulfil Gunther's wish from all those millions of years ago, and his transformation into a mad ice wizard begins. He chases Betty through the streets, shouting for his princess and firing icy blasts from his hands. While Betty is hiding around a corner, a portal suddenly appears beside her and a version of Simon from a thousand years in the future speaks to her through it. Simon tells her that she disappeared after he wore the crown, and, realising why, she jumps through the portal and joins him in the future. Following Betty's mysterious disappearance, the present day Simon begins to lose his sanity as he slowly succumbs to the crown. He records tapes documenting his physical and mental transformation. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>The visions. I fought with them. Shouted at them until I realised it wasn't real, it was the crown... Since then, I see the visions always, whether or not I wear the crown.

  <p class="quotesrc">Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
</div>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: In <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>, Simon states that when he took off the crown he saw Betty "staring at him with such contempt". However, in the episode <em>Betty</em> it is shown that Betty escaped to the future while Simon was still wearing the crown. It's possible he wore the crown once and then for some reason put it on a second time before Betty left.</p></font>

<h3>The Birth of Marceline Abadeer</h3>
<p>Marceline is a half-demon half-human hybrid, born just five years before the end of the world. Her father is Hunson Abadeer, the demonic ruler of the Nightosphere, and her mother is an unnamed human from Earth. It is not known how this unlikely relationship arose.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Then he said "fine". And that's the story of how I met your dad.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline's mother [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>

<p>It is also not clear exactly how involved Hunson is in his daughter's childhood. In her scrapbook, Marceline says that she doesn't know anything about him until they meet after the Great Mushroom War, but pictures of her as a child can be seen in his castle, suggesting her parents maintain some form of contact. [S04E05 <em>Return to the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>It seems like Hunson leaves them on their own them at some point shortly before the war:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Look kid, I want you to know I didn't abandon you. You have no idea how hard it was to let you go. Times were tough&nbsp;- even you know that. Your world was ending, and my world devolves into lawlessness when I'm not there.</p>

<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>Seeing Red</em>, and other secondary sources published before the <em>Stakes</em> miniseries suggest that Marceline grew up with her father and was a vampire from birth. This is completely false.</p></font>
<p>For some reason, Marceline has almost no memory of her life before the war, so her memories of her mother are also faded. When she is very young, they go on trips to the beach, and they live in a mobile home for a while, but that is all we know about her. [S09E11 <em>Ketchup</em>, S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>

<h3>Prelude to the War</h3>
<p>The current Elementals meet up every once in a while for coffee. Their magic powers are limited due to the Earth Dimension's rigidity, but they begin to see visions of the impending war. Like Evergreen millions of years before her, Patience St Pim seeks a way to survive this cataclysm, but the other Elementals disagree.

<p>The show also shares a lot of its music with real life, including pieces from classical musicians like Mozart and Beethoven as well as more modern music by artists like the Shirelles and Frank Loesser.

<h3>The Great Mushroom War and the Blue Catalyst Comet</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>The world was filled with explosions that were setting the land aflame from horizon to horizon. The human cretins had succeeded in their program to extinguish themselves from existence, and their insane Mushroom War had begun.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Hunson Abadeer, in the Encyclopaedia [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>After a quick escalation, the world erupts into nuclear war. The Great Mushroom War earns its name from the mushroom clouds produced by the bombs, which reduce most of human civilisation to ashes. By far the biggest is the "Mushroom Bomb", which is powered by something else besides its nuclear payload. It massively increases Earth's elasticity, delivering magic back into the world, and is likely what leaves the distinctive crater in the Earth's surface. It's possible that the whole thing is orchestrated by the Lich, since the bomb allows him to rise from his dormancy. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: It hasn't been confirmed how the crater was formed. The most obvious answer seems to be the Mushroom Bomb, but when it is seen detonating in <em>Finn the Human</em> and <em>Elemental</em>, it is nowhere near as destructive. Alternative theories are that it was formed by one of the Catalyst Comets, or by a combination of many of humanity's other nuclear weapons.</p></font>
<p>Despite the near extinction of the human race, there are several survivors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simon Petrikov buries himself under a thick blanket of snow and the crown protects him from the radiation after he emerges. [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</li>
  <li>Marceline Abadeer survives thanks to her half-demon physiology, but her mother doesn't make it. She is seen hiding in a cave while bombs go off outside, and is also seen watching a city burn to the ground. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, <em>Adventure Time #4</em>, S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</li>
  <li>Moseph "Moe" Mastro Giovanni, the owner of the robotics company MO Co, survives by becoming a cyborg. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>]</li>
  <li>Patience St Pim survives because she is frozen deep underwater, although the other Elementals perish. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</li>
  <li>Betty Grof has escaped through a portal to 999 AMB, skipping the war. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>]</li>
  <li>Many native werewolves and vampires survive. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</li>
  <li>The penguin form of Orgalorg survives because he is immortal. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
  <li>Several tribes of humans survive. These are presumably those who were far enough away from the blasts and somehow managed to avoid the radiation. [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel, S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</li>
  <li>Randall N. Byron survives by uploading his consciousness into a computer program. [<em>Adventure Time #13</em>]</li>
</ul>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em> states that Simon remained in hibernation for hundreds of years, but it is now known that he emerged immediately after the end of the war.</p></font>
<p>Due to the increased elasticity, the world begins to change very rapidly. Hybrid creatures are able to be born, and a variety of extra-dimensional creatures begin to flood in through spontaneously formed portals. Rainicorns enter the world and begin a tradition of hunting and eating the surviving humans, who become their main source of food. Rainicorns are able to live off the sparse population thanks to the fact that they are capable of absorbing massive amounts of sustenance from a small amount of meat. [S02E12 <em>Her Parents</em>, S08E04 <em>Lady Rainicorn of the Crystal Dimension</em>]</p>

  <p>There's enough nutrition in that macramÃ© owl on the wall there to feed this entire city for a year!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Lee [S08E04 <em>Lady Rainicorn of the Crystal Dimension</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The Vampire Court comes out from its hiding and also begins hunting humans. The court consists of five powerful vampires: the Fool, the Empress, the Moon, the Heirophant, and the King. Many survivors are turned into mindless vampire minions who serve the higher members of the court. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>On top of all this, many humans become zombified or mutated by a mixture of radiation and magic, creating the oozers. Some zombified businessmen become preserved in an iceberg. [S05E14 <em>Simon & Marcy</em>, S01E08 <em>Business Time</em>]</p>
<p>The Super Porp company, a soda manufacturer, continues to operate. Humans are not needed thanks to full automation. [S06E29 <em>Dark Purple</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: In <em>Adventure Time #13</em>, it is stated that the war took place 1002 years before season 5. However, doing the relevant maths with this date would put the episode <em>Simon & Marcy</em> six years after the war, which doesn't make any sense. It would also cause the comet to hit four years after the war, which messes up a lot of dates. Therefore, this date has been disregarded.</p></font>
<hr>
<font color="dimgrey">
<p>Notes on the date of the war:</p>
<p>Estimates for the real-life date of the war have varied anywhere from the 1970s to the 2040s, based on different sets of evidence. In my opinion, the most compelling and recent evidence indicates that the start of the war is between 2000 and 2008. Marceline owns a USB flash drive in <em>Ketchup</em>, which were invented in 2000 in real life. A crashed F&#8209;117 Nighthawk is seen in <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>, which were retired from service in 2008 in real life. <em>Adventure Time</em> began airing in 2010, which makes this a good estimation for the end of the war since it was probably intended to take place in the "present day".</p>
<p>There is further evidence to support this time frame. A chart from <em>High Strangeness</em> appears to show world population over time. A massive dip is seen shortly after the year 2000, and the peak is just over six billion people, which was the approximate world population in that decade. The penny that Abraham Lincoln holds up when trying to bribe Death in <em>Sons of Mars</em> was minted in the year 20XX. The last two digits are obscured by dirt. Many characters use text speak like "BRB" and "OMG", which didn't become prevalent until the mid-2000s. The businessmen and Patience St Pim both have keypad mobile phones when they are thawed in <em>Business Time</em> and <em>Elemental</em>.</p>
<p>Background artist Ghostshrimp stated in his podcast (<em>Ghostshrimp & Friends 049</em>) that he believes the Mushroom War is set in the crew's collective pasts, because that's what most of the creative input for the war is based on, without any set date in mind; hence the VHS tapes in his backgrounds, and the theme song from <em>Cheers</em> which was one of Kent Osborne's favourite shows. He accuses fans of being over-analytical. Personally, I have no idea what he's talking about.</p>
<p>As previously discussed in the introduction, this timeline sets the Mushroom War to take place in 2010 CE for the purposes of assigning real life dates.</p>

<p>During or shortly after the end of the Great Mushroom War, the Blue Catalyst Comet strikes the Earth and leaves behind its Agent of Change, which initially takes the form of a butterfly. The butterfly will eventually be reincarnated as Finn Mertens.</p>

<p>Marceline appears to have been left there by her mother, who leaves a note for anyone who finds her:</p>

<h3>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</h3>
<p>Simon and Marceline have begun to settle into their post-apocalyptic lifestyle. Simon becomes a father figure to Marceline in a way that her real father had never been. He gives Marceline a rudimentary education despite the fact that his mental state continues to deteriorate. They both practice kung fu using books they find. Simon begins writing a journal called <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>One day, the two venture into an abandoned city to try to find "chicken soup" to cure Marceline's fever. They get pursued and cornered by oozers and Simon is forced to use the crown for self-defence, using his powerful ice magic to defeat them. However, it further transforms him and his descent into madness accelerates. At the same time, a collective consciousness called the Mother Gum forms in the ruins and begins helping them. Marceline is seven years old at this point and Simon is forty-seven. [S05E14 <em>Simon & Marcy</em>]</p>

<p>"Chicken soup" might be Simon's word for medicine which he uses to make Marceline feel less worried, which would explain why the "food truck" they find resembles an ambulance. Because of this, Marceline might have false memories of believing the medicine to actually be chicken soup. However, in <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em> and <em>Season 11 #1</em> the chicken soup is explicitly mentioned, so this theory doesn't hold if those stories are considered canonical.</p></font>
<p>Shortly after this, Marceline and Simon move into an abandoned penthouse apartment and see ghosts for the first time. It is possible that a low level Dead World briefly intersected with the material plane, and these ghosts were victims of the Great Mushroom War. It is also possible that this is when Simon begins to develop his "wizard eyes" which enable him to see into a dimension called the Spirit World.

<p>Simon's condition becomes so bad that he is hardly able to remember and write about the day's events, so Marceline takes over writing <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>, and renames it to <em>Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>.

<p>Shortly after this, an enormous tidal wave hits the city for one of many possible reasons.

This is likely the beginning of the formation of the island continent that would eventually become known as the Land of Ooo.

<p>Eventually the water stops rising, and Simon and Marceline arrive in another ruined city.</p>
<p>Ever since he first put it on, the crown has been urging Simon to re-establish Evergreen's realm of ice, so he finally decides to leave Marceline. To keep Marceline safe, he finds a way to reunite her with her father, Hunson Abadeer. He finds a copy of <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>, the book he co-authored with Betty Grof, and uses it to open a portal to the Nightosphere. He is then able to cast a "binding spell" on Hunson:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It was all there in the book, and even though I was losing my mind, I did it, Marceline! I completed the ritual! The portal actually opened! A rip between dimensions appeared. I saw Hunson and he saw me, each of us watching the other through a weird rip in the barrier that separates our two worlds. After I completed the binding spell on your dad the portal closed and everything went dark. God knows what I did.

<h3>Marceline and Hunson</h3>
<p>After travelling on her own for a while, Marceline stalks two survivors who turn out to be thylacine werewolves named Remi and Rosella, who are proficient in the arcane arts. She befriends them and they agree to help her summon her father, Hunson Abadeer, since they believe he can help them vanquish the tribe of vampires that threatens their pack. Remi and Rosella successfully summon him,  and he bursts uninvited into Marceline's makeshift fort. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Marceline! Long time no see. Some goober with glasses summoned me. Let's go suck some souls!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Hunson Abadeer [S10E07 <em>Marcy & Hunson</em>]</p>
</div>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: The episode <em>Marcy & Hunson</em> is probably suggesting that Simon directly summoned Hunson. However, according to Marcy's scrapbook, Simon simply cast a binding spell on Hunson, and then it was Remi and Rosella who actually summoned him. I'm going with the second scenario simply because there is more story behind it.</p></font>
<p>To Marceline's horror, Hunson takes Remi and Rosella's souls, reducing them to lifeless husks. Despite this, she knows that this is probably her only opportunity to get to know her father:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Even though I hate him for sucking the life from my friends, I need to humour him because, let's face it, who knows what he could do? I can't let him know I don't like him. I can't write him off too quickly. Besides, he's the only one with the answers. There is still so much I don't know about myself and where I come from.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Their relationship becomes somewhat stable after a day at an abandoned carnival, and Marceline believes she is beginning to understand her father's motives. She inherits the Abadeer Axe, the weapon used by Hunson to take over the Nightosphere all those years ago:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>When I touched it, a strange feeling coursed through my veins, like a jolt of energy. This axe has some serious juju about it. Good or bad, I didn't really care. It's a gift from my Dad, and I will cherish it forever. Funny how your feelings can change so completely.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Marceline, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
</div>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: The graphic novel <em>Seeing Red</em> suggests that Hunson turned the axe into a bass guitar when he gave it to Marceline. This contradicts the episode <em>It Came from the Nightosphere</em> when Hunson says "Did you turn it into some kind of lute?" and is therefore false.</p></font>
<p>Unfortunately, this friendship doesn't last long. Hunson says he wants to help the remaining werewolves with their vampire problem, so they track down the rest of the pack to a truck stop on Route 90. In a repeat of his previous actions, he wipes out the entire werewolf pack and claims that he "helped" them, since the vampires would have killed them anyway. Upset with him, Marceline goes into the truck stop and manages to make fries, but Hunson eats them. This is the last straw. In a rage, Marceline banishes him back to the Nightosphere, abruptly ending his nine day visit. She writes the <em>Fry Song</em> shortly after. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: An interview with Marceline seen in <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em> gives a completely different story regarding the fry incident. It's possible she made the story up to avoid the truth.</p></font>

<p>During her time alone, Marceline becomes familiar with human technology and learns how to use computers. [<em>Adventure Time #13</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: This is somewhat contradicted by <em>Broke His Crown</em>, in which Marceline hints several times that she doesn't understand any of the computer equipment that Bubblegum is using.</p></font>
<p>She returns to the city where Simon left her and starts living in the abandoned mall. All of the survivors who used to inhabit it have either perished or moved away by this time. She meets a dog that managed to survive on the food in the mall's pet shop, and names it Schwabl. At some point, Marceline converts the Abadeer Axe into an electric bass guitar, although she is still able to proficiently wield it as a weapon. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>Shortly after this, she meets a unicorn called Daniel while sleepwalking. He is killed by vampires and Marceline vows to destroy them all. This is possibly a dream, but nevertheless Marceline sets out to track down and kill the vampires. She learns to fight from books in the mall library. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world is beginning to lapse into an ice age. This is probably caused by a combination of Simon establishing his realm of ice and some kind of magic-induced nuclear winter:</p>

<h3>Marceline the Vampire Hunter</h3>
<p>Marceline stakes her first vampire, a simple minion who was trying to murder a sheep. She also stakes a vampire who was threatening a family of human survivors, but the survivors run away before she can talk to them. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S07E09 <em>The Empress Eyes</em>]</p>
<p>Before long, she is a proficient vampire hunter and manages to force a stake through the heart of the first member of the Vampire Court, the Fool. She realises that she is capable of using her demon soul-sucking ability to absorb his powers, and gains from him the ability to fly. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>Later, while trying to catch food, she accidentally lassos a human girl wearing a bunny hat, who runs away from her. She stalks her and discovers an entire tribe of survivors, who wear animal hats to protect their necks from vampire bites. They are led by a man named Two Bread Tom, and the bunny girl is named Jo. They initially run away from Marceline because of her sharp demon teeth and her ability to fly, but eventually come to trust her. She becomes good friends with Jo. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>Islands</em> graphic novel]</p>
<p>In the ruins of the city, Marceline meets a second tribe who appear to be an offshoot of the first. They spend their time hiding from a member of the Vampire Court named the Moon, so Marceline stakes her and absorbs her self-healing powers, meaning that she can sustain serious injuries without being permanently harmed. [<em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</p>
<p>At some point, the third member of the Vampire Court, the Empress, meets Simon and tricks him into doing her bidding. Marceline stakes the Empress and gains from her the power of invisibility. It is unknown whether or not she meets back up with Simon during this ordeal.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>If you really cared about him, why'd you let him degenerate into this pathetic clown character? He used to have more of a silver fox thing going on with his hair and those cute glasses. He was happier then, you know. When he was serving me.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">The Empress talking to Marceline [S07E09 <em>The Empress Eyes</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Back with the tribe, Two Bread Tom tells Marceline that they will not be able to stay on the mainland even if she kills all the vampires because of changing atmospheric conditions and the incoming magical nuclear winter. The tribe travels to the shoreline and begins refurbishing a large pre-war cargo ship. Marceline goes with them to protect them.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It's not just the vampires, or the oozers, or them hungry-looking rainbows. The latest atmospheric readings are going bananas. Something big is coming, and it's gonna change all this. No, we'd do best to clear out of this continent altogether.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Two Bread Tom [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The tribe is suddenly attacked by the last of the vampires and is forced to set sail as soon as possible. Marceline stakes the Heirophant, absorbing his shape-shifting powers. This leaves the Vampire King as the very last of his kind. However, just as she is forcing her stake through his heart, he bites her neck and transforms her into a vampire herself. The Vampire King is killed and Marceline proclaims the full title of "Marceline the Vampire Queen". The humans set sail without her. [S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: The comic miniseries <em>Marceline and the Scream Queens</em> features a vampire character named Keila. This has since been contradicted because Marceline is the last of her kind. Some of the other comics also suggest that Marceline is actually a ruler due to her title, but this is false.</p></font>
<p>Marceline realises that she is allergic to sunlight and craves the colour red. She becomes immortal and stops ageing in her late teens. After accidentally draining the blood from Schwabl, she tracks down the group of wizards who obtained the Enchiridion and steals it from them. She uses a resurrection spell on Schwabl, turning him into an immortal undead creature just like her. Necromancy is added to her growing repertoire of supernatural abilities. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: Marcy's scrapbook shows that Schwabl was red before Marceline became a vampire, but the <em>Stakes</em> miniseries shows that he has always been white.</p></font>
<p>Due to the advancing global winter, Marceline decides to use her undead powers to hibernate until it is over. She falls asleep in a cave with Schwabl, and uses the Enchiridion as a pillow. She remains in this state until the winter is over. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<h3>The Foundation of the Human Islands</h3>
<p>The human tribe sets sail without Marceline and heads south-west. On the thirty-third day of their voyage, the ship is attacked by sea monsters, but they are able to fend off the creatures. The next day, they arrive on a large island where they meet up with another tribe of humans. The leaders of the tribes begin fabricating a new society and name their new home "Founders' Island". [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: If the name of the island refers to just a single founder (i.e. Two Bread Tom) then the apostrophe would be placed like so: "Founder's Island". However, the name probably refers to multiple founders, and therefore the apostrophe should be placed after the word, like so: "Founders' Island". It is spelt the second way in the official cookbook, so that's what I'm going with.</p></font>
<p>A while later, once the humans have established a sizeable colony, Jo (Marceline's friend), Two Bread Tom, and an islander named Michiko embark on an expedition to explore more of the island. Jo gets abducted by a giant bird and carried to the other side of the island, and spends weeks making her way back again. Tom decides that, to avoid losing anyone else, the islanders should construct a guardian to kill anything that tries to enter or leave the Islands. When Jo returns, she disagrees with his plans to seal off the island, so she and a group of the other islanders rebel and split from the main group.</p>

<p>The humans on the Islands are able to survive the magical nuclear winter. Over the course of the next millennium, they rebuild their society to a level beyond pre-war technology. They reinvent cars, robotics, computers, flying machines, advanced medical technology, geoengineering and much more. At some point, a MO Co airship arrives at the Islands, so it's likely that MO Co helps design the final version of the Guardian. The animal hats originally worn by the tribe members to protect against vampire bites remain an important part of their culture and a symbol of their highly protective attitude. The tribe leaders, including Two Bread Tom, become deified in the islanders' mythology as the legendary "Founders", while Jo and the other splitters eventually become derogatorily known as "hiders" who try to escape the Islands.

<p>A chunk of the western former United States becomes isolated and forms the small island continent of Ooo. This process is incredibly quick due to the rapidly advancing winter, the Great Tidal Wave, and the elasticity of the world. Much of the cityscape becomes completely submerged under the ocean.

<p>After stumbling across a family portrait in an abandoned gas station, Bonnibel decides to create her own family. She uses her scientific equipment to animate three more gum people, who she names Aunt Lolly, Cousin Chicle and Uncle Gumbald. They begin to expand their small settlement.</p>
<p>Initially her new creations are obedient, but they soon begin to act more independently. Gumbald cuts down the taffy trees, builds his own cabin, and establishes plans to build an entire city out of candy. Bonnibel doesn't like this idea so floods his construction site by creating Butterscotch Lake. Tired of his niece's control issues, Gumbald devises a plan to depose Bonnibel by creating a potion called "Dum Dum Juice" that will render her completely stupid and unable to meddle in his plans. He creates Mr. Cream Puff as a love interest for Bonnibel to distract her, then double-crosses Molly and Chicle by testing the Dum Dum Juice on them, transforming them into the candy people who would later become known as Manfried and Crunchy. Before Gumbald can use it on Bonnibel, she is able to shatter the flask containing the potion, which spills over Gumbald and transforms him into Punchy.</p>
<p>Seeing how happy and carefree these new creations are, she decides to create more of the dumb and docile candy people by administering Dum Dum Juice to them as soon as they are created. She is only comfortable when she is the one in charge. In further revenge for Gumbald's actions, Bubblegum steals his plans to construct a city from candy and runs with it herself, under the title of Princess. [S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her, her subjects' original selves remain helplessly trapped within their new goofy faÃ§ades for over eight hundred years to come. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>

<h3>Marceline and Bonnibel</h3>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Marceline, word has it you're more than a thousand years old. Does that mean you spend a lot of time on the Internet checking for obituaries and going to friends' funerals? I mean, they must die, like, every week!</p>
  <p class="quotesrc"><em>Teen Zine</em> [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Marceline wakes up from her long hibernation, and is still alive thanks to the fact that vampires don't age. She meets Bonnibel Bubblegum, who by this point is preparing to construct her kingdom. Somehow, the Enchiridion that Marceline was carrying ends up stowed away on Mount Cragdor. It's possible that Marceline shows it to Bubblegum, who recognises its importance and has it protected. [S01E05 <em>The Enchiridion!</em>]</p>
<p>Despite their very opposite personalities, Marceline and Bubblegum become good friends thanks to their mutual longevity and even date for a while. Marceline takes Bubblegum to her first punk show where someone spills a chili dog on Bubblegum, so Marceline buys her a shirt from the merchandise counter to cover the stain. Despite hating the actual show, the shirt becomes Bubblegum's most treasured possession since it reminds her of all the good times they had together. [SDCC 2018: <em>P.B. & Marcy</em>, S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S05E29 <em>Sky Witch</em>]</p>
<p>They would also sometimes explore the candy mines together. After a lot of persuasion, Marceline manages to get Bubblegum to graffiti on the walls. [S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>, <em>Adventure Time Comics #23: "Forever (Not) Alone"</em>]</p>
<p>At around this time, Bubblegum coincidentally digs up both of the two gemstones which crashed to Earth millions of years ago. She turns them into magic amulets (not to be confused with the Time Amulet); the red one can shoot lasers and the blue one can bring robots to life. She gives the red one to Marceline and keeps the blue one for herself. [<em>Adventure Time #25</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: In the comics, Marceline is shown living in the Tree Fort at this time, which doesn't make any sense since this happens before Shoko's death. Also, it is implied that Bubblegum didn't create the candy people or claim the title of princess until after she met Marceline, which is now known to be false as shown in <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>.</p></font>
<p>Finn and Jake arrive during the construction of the Candy Kingdom while travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point. Marceline and Bubblegum are still on good terms at this point. Marceline gives them the Time Amulet which she has been holding ever since the last time Finn and Jake visited her. Since Marceline and Finn and Jake met each other in opposite order, the Time Amulet is actually an example of a causal loop, or a bootstrap paradox, having manifested from nothing with no true origin. The Time Amulet helps Finn and Jake to find their way home. [<em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: This sequence of events suggests that Marceline should already recognise Finn and Jake when they first meet in <em>Evicted!</em> However, it's possible that she eventually forgets their faces.</p></font>
<p>Marceline and Bubblegum fall out after Bubblegum becomes too obsessed with politics and building her kingdom and isn't able to make time for her friend anymore. [S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>, <em>Adventure Time #25</em>, <em>Marceline Gone Adrift #4</em>]</p>

</div>
<p>It's likely that Marceline goes back into hibernation multiple times, which would explain why her mental age doesn't seem to be that much older than her apparent physical age, and why she is still upset with her father about the fry incident nearly a thousand years after it occurred. [S02E01 <em>It Came from the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>She begins writing her angsty five hundred year journal at around this time, and also begins writing her annual hourly comics in 735 AMB. She claims to have been in a gang with three ghosts named Wendy, Booboo, and Georgie. Marceline might have also had a second dog named Pickles at some point, in addition to Schwabl.

<h3>Shoko</h3>
<p>Shoko is a reincarnation of the Blue Catalyst Comet and a previous life of Finn Mertens. When she is young, her parents apparently trade her right arm for a computer and then abandon her in a dojo, and she ends up becoming a freelance thief. [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</p>
<p>She has a pet tiger who happens to be a previous life of Jake the dog. [<a href="http://archive.is/hLB0t">Andy Ristaino's Spring</a>]</p>
<p>At one point, she meets the Ice King and frees him from a group of evil lunch ladies. [<em>Adventure Time #50</em>]</p>
<p>Around five hundred years after the Mushroom War, she is hired by the Bath Boy Gang to steal Princess Bubblegum's Blue Amulet, so she knocks herself out and gets taken into care within the walls of the fledgling Candy Kingdom, where she befriends Princess Bubblegum. She helps her complete her secret project, the Gumball Guardians, powerful robots that are charged with protecting the Candy Kingdom from evil. Bubblegum activates them using the power of the Blue Amulet. [<em>Ghostshrimp & Friends 049</em>, S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</p>
<p>Despite the initial plan, Shoko becomes conflicted about completing the job after Bubblegum gifts her a new robotic arm. However, she goes through with it anyway and attempts to steal the amulet while Bubblegum is asleep. She is spotted and attacked by the Gumball Guardians, who send her hurtling into the radioactive river which still surrounds the kingdom. Mutated and disfigured, but endowed with a new biological arm, Shoko crawls away and dies under the sapling of a willow tree.</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>You don't understand. The things I've seen Princess Bubblegum do... I wouldn't cross her if I were you. Her arsenal. Her temper. She's...</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Finn [<em>Princess and Princess</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>While Princess Bubblegum often comes across as a benevolent and carefree leader, the early Candy Kingdom is not as sweet as its name might suggest. She is largely feared by her subjects due to the fact that the story of the first candy people becomes warped and corrupted, framing Gumbald as the victim and Bonnibel as the enemy:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>She's an unknowable goddess. When the first candy people rose against her, she transformed them into hideous monsters. Her own brother Neddy: she imprisoned him beneath the great tree. And the rattleball boys? She iced all those guys. She's amazing, and she's flippin' scary.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Banana Guard 16 [S07E26 <em>The Thin Yellow Line</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>This reputation is not helped by several questionable authoritarian actions taken by Bubblegum in the early years of her reign. In order to enforce the law within the fledgling candy kingdom, Bubblegum first creates the Banana Guard. However, they are largely ineffective, so she invents a more serious police force, the aforementioned rattleballs:</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. Our righteous swords cut a swathe through the chaos, but we were too successful. Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational, and sentenced to death. I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Rattleballs [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Bubblegum takes extreme action by having all of them executed, and reinstates the Banana Guard. Rattleballs is the only unit to escape. He leaves the walls of the kingdom and goes to live in hiding in the dump. [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
<p>In her controlling paranoia, Bubblegum also establishes mass surveillance networks in her kingdom to watch her citizens and track their every move, although it is not known when exactly she establishes these. It might not have been until a much later point. [S04E20 <em>You Made Me</em>, S06E15 <em>Nemesis</em>, S06E22 <em>The Cooler</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<p>Despite all this, the Candy Kingdom becomes the most stable, safe, and powerful state in Ooo. Under the protection of the Gumball Guardians it grows into a prosperous nation. Bubblegum creates an electricity grid by harnessing the energy of the liquid produced by her brother Neddy, decontaminating the radioactive river in the process. Her territory expands to encompass a large portion of the grasslands. She builds a grand castle and spends a lot of her time locked up inside studying science. [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>, S07E01 <em>Bonnie and Neddy</em>, S04E16 <em>Burning Low</em>, S05E21 <em>The Suitor</em>]</p>
<p>In addition to the banana guards and the Gumball Guardians, she instates the Royal Hero Draft, a scheme to recruit warriors and heroes who will defend the kingdom. It is likely that Billy and later Finn and Jake became champions of the kingdom through that scheme. [<em>Candy Capers #1</em>]</p>

<h3>AMO and BMO</h3>

  <p>MO Co was founded over one thousand years ago by Moseph Mastro Giovanni, a sad and gentle man beloved only by those he built to belove him.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">DMO in 999 AMB [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>MO Co existed before the war and survived thanks to Moe becoming a cyborg. His factory is constructed in the Desert Lands. Moe builds many robots in his "MO" range for various purposes. The two most notable are AMO, who is built to receive love, and BMO, who is built to provide it. AMO is neglected by Moe and goes insane from a lack of love, so he decides to leave the factory on a pilgrimage. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>, S07E14-15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know</em>]</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need, such is the cruel physics of love that those who crave it most will repel it, and only the dang rich get richer.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">ALLMO [S07E14-15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know</em>]</p>

<p>BMO also leaves the factory. He would eventually end up living with Finn and Jake.</p>

  <p>BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son, but I guess I never ended up dating any women, so that's that. I sent BMO off into the world alone, hoping he could find a family of his own. Maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">Moseph Giovanni [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>]</p>

<p>Moe builds many more MOs to populate his factory and to look after him as he becomes older and older. He survives for a thousand years beyond the Great Mushroom War, although by that point he claims that his skin is pretty much the only part of him that remains human. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: BMO is genderless, but is usually assigned male pronouns. In <em>Angel Face</em>, which takes place in 1000 AMB, BMO claims that he is old enough to vote. Assuming that the voting age in Ooo is eighteen, the latest possible date of BMO's creation is therefore 982 AMB. However, he is probably much older than this given he was built before the Sleeping Fire Giants.</p></font>

<h3>The Fire Kingdom</h3>
<p>The MOs were not the only things Moe built. As previously mentioned, he probably had some involvement in the design of the Island Guardian and the Martian colony. Furthermore, he is responsible for the construction of legendary machines known as the Sleeping Fire Giants. [S07E14-15 <em>The More You Moe, The Moe You Know</em>]</p>

<p>The Fire Giants ignite the Fire Kingdom in the south of Ooo, allowing for the rise of the flame people. By 1000 AMB, the Fire Kingdom is one of the most powerful states in Ooo, perhaps second only to the Candy Kingdom. It is unknown what Moe's motives were for building such machines in the first place.</p>
<p>Eventually, the documentation for how to operate the Fire Giants is lost. They lie dormant in the catacombs of the Fire Kingdom for centuries. [<em>Beginning of the End #2</em>]</p>
<p>The history of the Fire Kingdom is one full of conspiracy, treachery, and regicide. One member of the royal family, who would later become known as "Flame King", plots to take the Red Throne by murdering the impeding heirs until it is rightfully his. A flame guard named Leroy assists in overthrowing seven different rulers to allow Flame King to eventually rise to power. One of those rulers is Flame King's brother, who is murdered by Flame King. His children Furnius and Torcho seek vengeance upon their uncle. [<em>Finn & Jake Investigations: "Sour Notes"</em>, S04E22 <em>Ignition Point</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: <em>The Virtue of Ardor</em> suggests that Flame King's name is Pyrrhus. However, this story is written by Tree Trunks to take place in a fictional universe and might not be true in the real world.</p></font>

<h3>The Other Kingdoms</h3>
<p>Numerous other kingdoms and states begin to crop up all over Ooo. Most of them are tiny and remain under the effective jurisdiction of the Candy Kingdom, such as the Hot Dog Kingdom. However, a few are large enough to rival it. Most notable among these are the aforementioned Fire Kingdom, the Slime Kingdom, and Wizard City. The princesses and other leaders form various political organisations to keep the peace. Princess Bubblegum, ruler of the Candy Kingdom, does her best to remain the de facto dictator of Ooo through a combination of excellent diplomacy and some other shadier dealings.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>The princess even other princesses call "The Princess". Sweet as candy. Just as bad for my teeth. Bubblegum.</p>
  <p class="quotesrc">BMO [<em>Adventure Time #35</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>The Slime Kingdom eventually falls under the rule of Slime Princess, who is the reincarnation of the Slime Elemental following the death of the previous one in the Great Mushroom War. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>Most kingdoms are ruled by a leader with the title "princess", even though prior to the war this title was used only by female heirs. This is because Bubblegum chose to adopt the title in revenge for Gumbald mockingly calling her "prinzessin". It's likely that the other kingdom founders follow suit. [S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>However, some kingdoms including Lumpy Space and the Fire Kingdom continue to use the title in the traditional sense, with the actual rulers being called kings and queens. [S01E02 <em>Trouble in Lumpy Space</em>, S03E26 <em>Incendium</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum probably distributes the Gems of Power from the Enchiridion to some of the other royals for safekeeping. They all attach the gems to their crowns, including Bubblegum who keeps one for herself, granting them immunity to the Lich's telepathic abilities. [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: One of the Gems of Power is a gem from Evergreen's crown, even though the crown gems are known to have a different origin.</p></font>
<p>Much of the history of Ooo's royalty is documented in a book written by Turtle Princess, which is creatively named <em>Royalty of Ooo</em>. Turtle Princess is the ruler of the library, and her books are secretly under the protection of the pagelings; paper creatures who fight off the book-soiling moldos.

  <p class="quotesrc">Pudding Troll [S10E09 <em>Blenanas</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>Every Thursday, a comic magazine called <em>Ble</em> is printed and distributed from an office in the ruins of a pre-war city. But five hundred years before the events of the series, their office suddenly and mysteriously ceases printing, leaving the skeletons of former employees slowly gathering dust at their desks. Ice King continues to send them his own short stories (sometimes featuring Fionna and Cake), but to no avail.</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: It's possible that the employees were already dead by the time the Pudding Troll was employed to guard the building, so the magazine might actually have ceased production before or during the Mushroom War. This would explain why the skeletons appear to be human and why the offices are in pre-war ruins. This is further evidenced by the fact that <em>Bletters to the Bleditor</em>, a piece in the SDCC 2018 crew zine, made reference to several real world pre-war locations, such as Las Vegas and London.</p></font>

The Nameless Kingdom was directly mentioned in <em>Adventure Time #75</em>, suggesting that it does indeed exist. Additionally, the final form of Nightmare Princess in <em>SotNK</em> looks very similar to Nightmare Princess from the episode <em>Orb</em>. This appears to be the show acknowledging the existence of the Nameless Kingdom, but might also suggest that the game is non-canon since Finn does not recognise the princess when they meet in <em>Orb</em>.</p></font>

<h3>Magic Man's Banishment to Earth</h3>
<p>In his grief and madness over the loss of Margles, Magic Man has spent the past few millennia tormenting the people of Mars. Most notoriously, he creates three plagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Plague of Shadows causes people's shadows to come to life and attack them.</li>
<li>The Plague of the Oneness causes every Martian to become stuck hand in hand.</li>
<li>The Plague of Hair causes all the water to turn into hair. The Martians get so thirsty that they drink it, and it makes them go bald, hence why many of them wear "groovy headgear".</li>
</ul>
<p>His last act against the Martians is chaining them all together and driving over them with a school bus as a literal enactment of "throwing them under the bus". After escaping from the chains, Abraham Lincoln gives up trying to reason with Magic Man and finally sentences him to banishment. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, S08E07 <em>Normal Man</em>]</p>

<div class="quote">

<h3>Martin Mertens' Space Adventure</h3>
<p>Martin is pulled from the ocean by the same crew that was once captained by Tree Trunks. He has a severe head injury, which is probably the cause of his memory loss and insanity later in life. [<a href="http://kingofooo.tumblr.com/post/156685218519/gingerlandcomics-a-pair-of-v-emotional-episodes"><em>Min and Marty</em> promo art</a>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: The promo art for <em>Min and Marty</em> suggests that it was Tree Trunks' crew (from <em>Ring of Fire</em>) who pulled Martin from the ocean. However, Tree Trunks was already living in the Candy Kingdom with Wyatt at the time of Jake's birth as shown in <em>Joshua & Margaret Investigations</em>. For Tree Trunks to have been captain of <em>La Femme du la Mer</em> at the time of Martin's escape, either she would have had to build and sell off her company in a matter of months, or Finn is significantly older than Jake, neither of which seem plausible. Therefore, Mr. Fine-Dooty must have survived Tree Trunks' attempt to murder him, and Tree Trunks probably never knew Martin.</p></font>
<p>Following this, Martin somehow ends up in space, where he becomes a criminal and, for the most part, forgets about the family he used to love. However, he still maintains some memory of his past:</p>

<p>She joins a tribe of "hyoomans": humanoid fish creatures who live underground in an abandoned shopping mall called Beautopia, which could be the same mall where the human refugee camp existed following the war and where Marceline camped out before becoming a vampire hunter. The hyoomans are evicted from their home by gaseous monsters known as lub glubs, and retreat to a bunker beneath the Candy Kingdom. They are fearful of the outside world, so remain hidden for years.

<h3>BMO's Last Reboot</h3>
<p>Since BMO had an uptime of 4748 days (exactly thirteen years) in 998 AMB, he must have undergone a reboot in about 985 AMB. [<em>Adventure Time #13</em>]</p>
<p>This reboot might be the reason that BMO does not remember the details of his own creation, since the mind of a MO is wiped during the re-installation of system drivers. However, this could just be a result of his highly inaccurate memory recollection. Despite this, BMO retains emergency instructions detailing how to get back to the MO Factory should he ever need new core system drivers. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>, S09E11 <em>Ketchup</em>]
<p>It is unknown when exactly BMO enters the lives of Finn and Jake. He could have belonged to Marceline in the Tree Fort before they moved in, or Finn and Jake could have adopted him on a whim like they tried to do with the jiggler, or he could have belonged to Joshua and Margaret. The only certain thing is that he lives in the Tree Fort by the beginning of the show.</p>

<p>Gata wanders the land and ends up climbing in through Joshua and Margaret's window. They decide to raise her as a sister to Jake and Jermaine. Later on, after Finn has also joined the family, Joshua closes the portal in his adopted daughter's mouth by using a magical item which turns her into a stone statue and erases her from the memories of everyone who knew about her.

<h3>The Time Slips</h3>
<p>In the future, a creature called Clock Bear escapes from Dr Gross' menagerie and hides out in the attic of Joshua and Margaret's private investigation bureau. He causes several "time slips" between the 980s and 1001 AMB, making the house seem haunted. This also allows the future versions of Finn and Jake to subtly interact with their dead parents, and future Jake witnesses his own unconventional birth. [S10E08 <em>The First Investigation</em>]</p>

<h3>Finn, Jake and Jermaine's Upbringing</h3>
<p>At some point, the family moves out of the investigation bureau in the city and into a large house atop a hill in the countryside. [<em>Adventure Time #48</em>, S10E08 <em>The First Investigation</em>]</p>
<p>While the boys seem to have a fairly close relationship with their parents, things are not as simple as they might seem. Margaret is overprotective of her children and limits their freedoms. On the other hand, Joshua is eager for his children to become adventurers like him and designs deadly dungeons for them to take part in. He even teaches Jake how to pickpocket. This combination probably makes for an unhealthy family dynamic and could be responsible for Jake's later criminality.

  <p class="quotesrc">Jake [S09E04 <em>Winter Light</em>]</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, Jermaine appears to take a back seat behind his two brothers. He isn't a powerful shape-shifter or an exotic human, so his parents seem to show less interest in him than in their other two boys. He is once accidentally knocked out by Jake while they are play-fighting. Jermaine probably craves attention from his parents, which might explain why he's the one who would later stay and look after the house following their death. [S02E08 <em>Crystals Have Power</em>, S06E33 <em>Jermaine</em>]</p>
<p>Both parents also keep secrets from their children. They never tell Jake the true origin of his powers or that Margaret is not his biological mother. Jake grows up believing that he gained his powers from rolling in a magic mud puddle and Finn grows up believing he was born from a cabbage. [S06E16 <em>Joshua & Margaret Investigations</em>, S01E14 <em>The Witch's Garden</em>, S01E22 <em>Henchman</em>]</p>

<p>Ice King, along with Finn and Jake, explores the dungeon he built with Hunson Abadeer two hundred years previously. They discover the Echo of the Lich and are each transported to their ideal worlds. Finn is transported to Farmworld, where his mother and father are alive. Jake is transported to a world where Finn gets to enjoy his powers. Ice King is transported to a world where Betty is alive, and he claims to be free of the crown's madness. However, all of these are just fabrications. Against Ice King's will, Finn and Jake destroy the impersonations and safely return to the real world. [<em>Adventure Time #16</em> to <em>#19</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: This specific arc does not occur in the main timeline, because Finn has no recognition of his Farmworld form since those episodes never happened due to the Lich being dead.</p></font>

<h3>997 AMB (3007 CE)</h3>
<p>Princess Bubblegum creates a time machine capable of transporting its user back to the moment at which it was first created, where the user will replace their past self. She destroys it after Jake misuses its power, so Jake gets Neptr to repair it. The repaired time machine transports a duplicate of Finn and Jake's minds fifteen years into the future, where they replace the minds of their future selves. Shortly after this, BMO accidentally creates two evil robots that begin to replicate themselves. [<em>Adventure Time #6</em> to <em>#7</em>]</p>

<h3>0 AMB (2010 CE)</h3>
<p>There is still a nuclear war. However, rather than meeting after the war, Marceline and Simon become friends beforehand, and Marceline is able to assist Simon in his battle with Evergreen's crown. He remains sane enough that he succeeds in completely stopping the Mushroom Bomb using his ice powers. Unfortunately he is crushed to death under the weight of the frozen bomb, and Evergreen's crown grieves its fallen master by plunging the world into an apocalyptic ice age. The Blue Catalyst Comet misses the Earth and never delivers its Agent of Change. Marceline never becomes a vampire and therefore ages into an old woman, but is kept alive for the next thousand years by her demon physiology. She guards the crown and Simon's body.</p>
<div class="quote">
  <p>One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish unworthy planet from annihilation. Frightful bombs poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror. But using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight; only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day. Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished. Then the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire Earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years.</p>

<h3>999 AMB (3009 CE)</h3>
<p>A creature named the Mnemonoid feeds on stories, which are its main source of food. It attacks the Tree Fort and begins stealing Finn's memories since they are an excellent source of stories. Finn continues to live normally, but at periodic points he suddenly forgets several years of his life. [<em>Adventure Time #31</em>]</p>
<h3>1004 AMB (3014 CE)</h3>
<p>Finn forgets the previous five years of his life, and is suddenly five years older with no memory of the intervening time. This alternate future is completely inconsistent with the show; for example, the Gumball Guardians are still operational. By this point, Bubblegum and Marceline are the co-ruling queens of the so-called "Candy Vampire Kingdom". Small fights frequently break out between the Fire, Sand, Water, and Air kingdoms. The Mnemonoid shows up again and begins stealing more of Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #32</em>]</p>

The Mnemonoid attacks once again and kills Marceline by exposing her to direct sunlight, then begins stealing even more of Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #33</em>]</p>
<h3>1059 AMB (3069 CE)</h3>
<p>Finn forgets another thirty-five years of his life. He travels completely alone, suggesting that most of his other companions have passed away by now. The world is frozen over, which could be the result of the crown grieving the loss of Ice King like it did in the Farmworld timeline. Bubblegum, depressed and alone without Marceline, lives in the frozen war-torn ruins of the Candy Kingdom. Luckily, Finn is able to remember the plans for the time machine from the robot apocalypse timeline. He travels back to the present day and is able to erase the timeline by making Mnemonoid be friends with LSP, an infinite source of gossip which is able to sustain him much more effectively than Finn's memories.

<p>Commandant Banana Guard, the former captain, is envious of Root Beer Guy for taking his job and plots to sabotage him by deliberately failing all of the new recruits after Princess Bubblegum opens the Banana Guard Academy to non-bananas. The recruits make plans to have the Commandant fired and replaced. The original candidate for his replacement is Lemongrab, but after he is killed by Lemonhope, Bubblegum offers the job to Root Beer Guy in addition to his captaincy. However, he is also killed during Maja's attack. So far, the Banana Guard timeline remains almost identical to the main timeline with the exception of the fact that the Banana Guard is open to non-bananas. [<em>Banana Guard Academy #1</em> to <em>#4</em>]</p>
<p>After Peppermint Butler consults an oracle to ask whether or not they should have Commandant Banana Guard replaced, the timeline fractures into two alternate realities; one where the Commandant is fired, and one where he keeps his position. Peppermint Butler is able to repair the Multiverse after talking to the ghost of Root Beer Guy, but the reunified timeline inadvertently leads to another robot apocalypse.

<p>Five years later, Peppermint Butler and the small group of remaining rebels journey to the Citadel of Temporal Attunement, where he is able to travel back in time and undo the apocalypse by preventing Princess Bubblegum from opening the Banana Guard to non-bananas. This erases the entire timeline, leaving Peppermint Butler as the only one able to remember it. He apparently makes no attempt to prevent the defeat of Lemongrab or the death of Root Beer Guy since they end up happening in the main timeline anyway.

The main evidence that the two shows are set in the same continuity is an image that was shown for a single frame during Chris' premonition in the episode <em>Ultra Wankershim</em>, which shows planet Earth with a large chunk missing, just like the Earth in <em>Adventure Time</em>. A popular fan theory is that Chris is descended from Finn, given their blond hair and similar personalities. It's also conceivable that the rest of the humans living on NeoMars are descended from the Islanders. However, this is all just speculation.</p>

She forgets about many of her closest friends, most notably Princess Bubblegum, but she still does not wish to return to the Nightosphere. Hunson Abadeer takes more and more drastic action to uncover and remove Marceline's memories, like trying to trigger them by discovering old artifacts.

<h3>A Thousand Years Later</h3>
<p>Time brings many changes to the Land of Ooo.</p>
<p>The original Candy Kingdom has expanded into a vast metropolis, but has since been abandoned. The great tree at its centre, which once sustained Neddy, has withered and died. Most of the candy people appear to be held in stasis on board the Prize Ball Guardian, an immense robotic replacement for the Gumball Guardians who were destroyed during the second coming of GOLB. The Hot Dog Kingdom has grown into a far larger kingdom that it used to be. A character named Pawn Swan roams the land selling his wares, much like Choose Goose did a thousand years before him. [S05E51 <em>Lemonhope Part Two</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>, <a href="http://wolfhard.tumblr.com/post/118388594601/graybles-1000-second-promo-tonight-coming-at"><em>Graybles 1000+</em> promo art</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wolfhard/status/1038082635795292161">Steve Wolfhard's Twitter</a>]</p>
<p>Some other characters from the time of the series are known to survive until this time. Ironically, Sweet P (formerly the Lich) grows up to be a great hero and inherits the Night Sword from Finn. The new form of Gunter continues to rule over the north of Ooo fused with Evergreen's crown as the Ice Thing. As previously mentioned, BMO survives thanks to the fact that he's a robot. The original King of Ooo is still alive. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>, SDCC 2018: <em>Ble crew zine "Kings of Ooos"</em>]</p>
<p>Other characters do not get the opportunity to live forever. The Jiggler's casket and Mr. Fox's skull are seen in BMO's collection. Finn and Jermaine's gravestones are both seen, although intriguingly there doesn't appear to be one for Jake. It's possible that Jake lives much longer thanks to all the life essence he absorbed from his biological father. A monument to Finn is seen too, as well as a monument to either Jake or Jermaine. Simon is probably dead, given he was turned back into a normal human, although it's possible that Betty's wish to keep him safe extends his lifespan. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>
<p>The Earldom of Lemongrab also remains intact but abandoned. As promised, Lemonhope returns to it a thousand years after departing the Candy Kingdom to explore the world. Despite Finn and Jake's disappearance from the world, Lemonhope meets them while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point, and informs them that their legacy has survived.

<p>All five elementals are confirmed to be present in the intro to the finale. Therefore, Princess Bubblegum or a future reincarnation of her is probably the unknown pink skinned individual seen behind bars in the Ice Thingdom. This means that the unknown individual holding the telescope could be Marceline, which is further evidenced by the symbol on the telescope which somewhat resembles her initials, "MA", and the fact that the individual rides the duck creature previously seen in Marceline's debut episode. Patience St Pim is still frozen in a ball of ice. Slime Princess and Flame Princess have died and been reincarnated into new forms, who are seen fighting each other. Lumpy Space Princess has also died and been reincarnated.

<p>The hybrid descendants of Jake and Lady Rainicorn become a dominant race known as "pups" due to how quickly they are able to breed and grow up. They build a city, possibly alongside the humans from the Islands, and reinvent advanced space travel, connecting Earth with other space-capable civilisations including the grey aliens. The pups appear to be ruled by Gibbon, the son of Charlie and one of Jake's grandchildren. Gibbon has obtained one of the jewels from the Ice Thing, which is likely what grants him his immortality and his pink ice powers. In addition, he learns the power to "extinguish" other pups' powers.

Another of their friends is Princess Zip, a grey alien who wears a crown just like Princess Bubblegum's, although there seem to be several such crowns in the future; BMO alone owns at least four of them. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>
<p>Beth, whose former full title is Princess Betony Burrito Jakson IV, runs away from her kingdom to avoid having her powers extinguished by Gibbon, and remains a fugitive. This explains why she and Shermy live in Marceline's hidden-away cave, and also explains why a pup is seen spying on their house.

<p>One day, Shermy and Beth discover a mysterious object scuffed up by the feet of the Prize Ball Guardian. They decide to bring it to the legendary King of Ooo, BMO, at the top of Mount Cragdor, who identifies it as Finn's bionic arm which was bitten off by GOLB a thousand years prior. BMO goes on to tell Shermy and Beth the story of the Great Gum War and the second coming of GOLB. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>

<h3>The Graybles</h3>
<p>On a planet far from Earth, a baby alien called Cuber gets lost in a cave and is threatened by a vicious dog-like creature. He is rescued by his sister Tuber. [S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<font color="dimgrey"><p>Note: <em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em> and the graphic novel <em>Graybles Schmaybles</em> suggest that Cuber was alive during the events of the series. This is probably false.</p></font>
<p>Some of the past events of Ooo become preserved as short stories known as graybles, which are used by Cuber later in his life for entertainment and utility. [S04E02 <em>Five Short Graybles</em>, S05E03 <em>Five More Short Graybles</em>, S05E24 <em>Another Five More Short Graybles</em>, <em>Finn & Jake Investigations</em>]</p>
<p>After accidentally killing the bride of a space wedding between two pups, Cuber is attacked by several of their vessels. Fearing for his life, he flees from his spaceship in an escape pod and crash lands on the surface of Earth near the former Candy Kingdom. While on the run he accidentally destroys the Prize Ball Guardian which was carrying all the candy people, possibly ending Princess Bubblegum's legacy for good. He steals one of his assailant's ships, and is able to climb back into space and safely return to his own ship, apparently unaware of how much he had just destroyed. [S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</p>
<p>Cuber briefly meets Finn and Jake while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point, and recognises them as the protagonists of his graybles. From their perspective, he is the first person they meet. But from a chronological perspective, he is the last. [<em>Beginning of the End</em> bonus chapter]</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>Hey, elephant. I'm more ancient than you. Someday I will engulf the Solar System. What was and what will be is meaningless. Meanwhile, you should wonder: are you just a two-headed pile of meat on a crash course with a cosmic dump, or do you contain the sole memory of a million dead stars? How do you light a candle without a match?</p>

<p>Death once claimed that Simon would continue to exist as the Ice King until this time, but this has since been proven false. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>

<h2>THE END</h2>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Time is an illusion that helps things make sense<br>
  So we are always living in the present tense<br>
  It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends<br>
  But you and I will always be back then</p>
</div>
<p>I may live on Earth, but a part of me will always belong in the Land of Ooo. It's been quite the adventure, and I'm glad to have been a small part of this wonderful story. Thank you for reading.</p>
