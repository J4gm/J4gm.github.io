<p>First things first, this post is <strong>really long</strong>. If you don't want to read it all right now, I recommend bookmarking it so you can come back to it later. This was originally going to be a Reddit text post, but it quickly exceeded the forty thousand character limit and now stands at over four times that amount, which is why I've moved it to a separate site. This also means I can continue to update the timeline for as long as new <em>Adventure Time</em> content is being released.</p>
<p>Secondly, this timeline contains <strong>all the spoilers</strong>, up to and including <em>Come Along With Me</em>, the finale. Please don't read it unless you've finished the show and you've read all the comics you intend to read. I also recommend you read <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, since a lot of the timeline draws from that.</p>
<p>I am from the UK, so one must pardon any British spelling or grammar.</p>
<p>Please leave your thoughts and criticisms in the comments section at the bottom of the page, and keep it civil. If you would like to message me privately, send a PM to one of my social media accounts, linked at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h3>
<img src="images/thank you.png" alt="Thank You">
<p>This post was inspired by several <em>Adventure Time</em> timelines published before it. The main reason I started this project was because <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/IpzJZ">the timeline by RedLionKing</a> has become outdated and only deals with the core storyline, although my version isn't anywhere near as beautifully written so I recommend you check it out anyway. Also credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/66ku1x/complete_adventure_time_timeline_spoilers/">this concise timeline by Viernes de Siluetas</a>, from whom I stole the date system.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/uncivilizedelk">Uncivilized Elk</a> for his in-depth episode analysis videos which have inspired some details of the timeline, and thanks to all the editors and transcribers on the <a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki"><em>Adventure Time</em> Wiki</a> without whom this task would have been a lot more arduous.</p>
<p>Lots of credit to <a href="https://spiderciderko.tumblr.com/">SpiderCider</a> and <a href="https://already-19.tumblr.com/">DÃ©cadent</a> for painstakingly translating this entire piece into Korean for our friends in the east. If anyone is interested in providing translations for any other languages, drop me a PM.</p>
<p>And of course, thanks to Pendleton Ward and the entire <em>Adventure Time</em> crew for creating one of the most deep, complex, and inspiring worlds in the history of children's television.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<img src="images/paper pete 2.png" alt="Paper Pete">
<p>This timeline is designed to be as complete as possible. This means that not only am I drawing events from the show, but also from many other pieces of officially licensed material, including comics, video games, and graphic novels.</p>
<p>One question that gets thrown around a lot is "Are the comics canon?" The short answer is no. <a href="https://twitter.com/UncivilizedElk/status/1034295557051695104">Adam Muto</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPendarvis/status/1028301567294889985">Jack Pendarvis</a> have both clearly stated that they are not. However, the comics are officially licensed, and many of them fit very neatly into the lore of the show. In fact, the only comics which are dramatically irreconcilable with the show are the Bag of Holding arc, in which Finn and Jake throw the Lich into the Sun, and the <em>Seeing Red</em> graphic novel, which contains a multitude of inaccuracies regarding Marceline's past. Other than that, there are only minor plot holes to overlook. Therefore, I'm going to treat the comics like an alternate timeline, which leaves me free to selectively choose which elements I include in the main timeline.</p>
<p><a href="media.html">Click here</a> for a list of every single piece of media which has been considered for the timeline. I have also considered things like promotional art and social media posts from members of the show's crew, although these are often tongue-in-cheek and shouldn't be taken as canon in every instance. Storyboards and other production material might also be sourced, but only for clarification; cut scenes do not count. Scrapped episodes also do not count.</p>
<p>Whenever I make a statement or pull a quote from somewhere, I will show the source in square brackets [like this]. That way, you can make up your own mind whether or not you choose to believe a certain element is canon.</p>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Adventure_Time_episodes#Episodes">official season arrangement</a> for labelling episodes, which is the arrangement composed of ten seasons used by Cartoon Network and Wikipedia but not the one used by the fan wiki and some members of the crew. For example, <em>Elemental</em> is S08E08 rather than S07E34. This doesn't affect the order of individual episodes in any way, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="date-system">Date system</h3>
<img src="images/high strangeness.png" alt="High Strangeness">
<p>All dates are organised around a year zero, which is the year of the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb and the impact of the Catalyst Comet. BMB stands for Before Mushroom Bomb and AMB stands for After Mushroom Bomb. The letter c before a date stands for circa, and indicates that this is an estimated date. The letter X is used to denote any digit (e.g. 99X could be any year from 990 to 999). A corresponding real-life date is displayed in brackets. Since the beginnings and ends of years are not clear, many events may be one year off. Where applicable, the New Year is assumed to be Finn's birthday.</p>
<p>Estimates for the real-life date of the war have varied anywhere from the 1970s to the 2040s, based on different sets of evidence. In my opinion, the most compelling and recent evidence indicates that the start of the war is between 2000 and 2008. In <em>Ketchup</em>, Marceline owns a USB flash drive, which were invented in 2000 in real life. In <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>, a crashed F-117 Nighthawk is seen, which were retired from service in 2008 in real life. <em>Adventure Time</em> began airing in 2010, which makes this a good estimation for the end of the war since it was probably intended to take place in the "present day".</p>
<p>There is further evidence to support this time frame. The chart above (right of PB) is from <em>High Strangeness</em> and appears to show world population over time. A massive dip is seen shortly after the year 2000, and the peak is just over six billion people, which was the approximate world population in that decade. The penny that Abraham Lincoln holds up in <em>Sons of Mars</em> was minted in the year 20XX. The last two digits are obscured by dirt. Many characters use text speak like "BRB" and "OMG", which didn't become prevalent until the mid-2000s. The businessmen and Patience St Pim both have keypad mobile phones when they are thawed from the ice, in <em>Business Time</em> and <em>Elemental</em>.</p>
<p>For labelling things with a real-life date, I have assumed that <strong>0&nbsp;AMB&nbsp;=&nbsp;2010&nbsp;CE</strong>.</p>
<p>The Mushroom Bomb and the war-time Catalyst Comet hit at approximately the same time. Uniting these two pivotal events makes it much easier to put a date to things, so I have assumed that they both take place in 0 AMB.</p>

<h3 id="the-beginning-of-the-multiverse">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<p><strong>The Beginning of the Multiverse</strong></p>
<img src="images/gold stars.png" alt="Gold Stars" style="width:96%;">
<blockquote>
  <p>Before there was time - before there was anything - there was nothing. And before there was nothing, there were monsters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- The Lich [S06E26 <em>Gold Stars</em>]</p>
<p>Reality exists as an infinite chaotic sea of monsters, including beings like Orgalorg, GOLB, and possibly the Lich. By incomprehensible chance, the monsters eventually come to a common agreement on the state of reality, and this consensus becomes the Multiverse. Therefore, despite its appearance to those who inhabit it, the Multiverse is not actually material. The Multiverse is an emergent product of consciousness rather than consciousness being an emergent product of the Multiverse. Every sentient being that lives in the Multiverse paradoxically maintains its existence by experiencing it, and this also means that every sentient being has an existence beyond the material, known as their soul.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Third Orb does not exist, said the Sage.<br>
  <font color="steelblue">Why? asked the Student.</font><br>
  Because the Multiverse, said the Sage, within which Third Orb exists, does not exist. The Multiverse is a Consensus Reality shared by the Minds of all Sentient Beings. If they were to Die, the Multiverse, as such, would suddenly blink out of existence, vanish, be no more.<br>
  <font color="steelblue">Why? asked the Student.</font><br>
  Because, said the Sage, there would be no one to Perceive It.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Other than this, the origins of the Multiverse are largely unknown. Nobody knows where the monsters came from or what the true nature of reality is. Everything we know about the world before existence comes from that single glimpse granted by the Lich.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Where did the Multiverse come from? Since logic dictates that asking this question must result in an infinite regression â€” What created the Multiverse? And what created the Thing that created the Multiverse? Etcetera â€” this suggests that the mental engine of logical thinking is not designed to determine the Answer.</p>

<h3 id="the-structure-of-existence">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<p><strong>The Structure of Existence</strong></p>
<img src="images/the lich.png" alt="The Lich" style="width:96%;">
<p>The Multiverse imagined by the primordial monsters is composed of a vast (perhaps infinite) number of "dimensions" which each hold a universe. One of these is the Earth Dimension, which contains the planet Earth (sometimes referred to as "Third Orb") as well as all the other planets, stars, and galaxies in our own universe. Other dimensions include the Astral Plane, the Crystal Dimension, Lumpy Space, the Nightosphere, the Citadel, and many more. Amidst this complex system of dimensions is the Time Room:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At the centre of the Multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming wormholes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronisation allowing for the safe passage of particles through a non-local region of space-time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Booko [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>
<p>The physics behind the concept of the Multiverse is somewhat explained in chapter four of the Wizards' Enchiridion, albeit in a very hand-wavy pseudo-scientific way. To prevent all of the dimensions from catastrophically colliding with one another, all particles in a specific dimension have their own unique "frequency". Particles with different frequencies reside in different dimensions. Adjusting this frequency allows for interdimensional travel. Another property of each dimension is its "elasticity", which determines how easy it is to change the frequency of particles within that dimension. As stated above by Booko, dimensions can be interlinked if the frequencies of the particles in a local region of both dimensions can be somehow synchronised, hence forming a kind of gateway called a "portal". This is easier in more elastic dimensions. A very rudimentary form of temporal synchronisation is demonstrated by Finn when he interacts with the little people, who reside in "a different dimensional plane" according to Jake. Finn shakes the little people, which synchronises their frequencies enough to allow for brief interdimensional communication. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S05E05 <em>All the Little People</em>]</p>
<p>The elasticity of a dimension has other effects besides ease of interdimensional travel. For example, highly elastic dimensions are more easily influenced by magic (more on that in a couple of sections), and are more likely to allow for interspecies hybrids to be born. The most extreme known examples of hybrids seen in the show are Jake's descendants, who contain genes from at least four species; bears, rainicorns, dogs, and shape-shifters. The elasticity of a dimension can vary with time. Earth was elastic in the time of the dinosaurs, then became very rigid during modern times, then elastic once again following the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb. [S06E12 <em>Ocarina</em>, S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p><em>Note: A slightly more scientifically rooted explanation for the structure of the Multiverse is alluded to in storyboard panels from <em>Crossover</em>. The panels cite a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~alinde/1032226.pdf">1994 Scientific American article</a> by physicist Andrei Linde which talks about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation">eternal inflation model</a>. However, this model has never been explicitly referenced in the show and is pretty much irreconcilable with the other model.</em></p>
<p>One final principle of the Multiverse is the concept of "Amok Time", which states that causality can sometimes be reversed. This allows for accurate predictions of the future and the occasional bit of time travel. At the very beginning of time there is a place called the Vanishing Point, and anyone who gets trapped there will be erased from history. Jake the Dog claims to have seen the Big Bang while travelling back in time to visit the Vanishing Point. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, <em>Beginning of the End #3</em>]</p>

<h3 id="the-cosmic-entities">c. 13.8 billion BMB/BCE</h3>
<p><strong>The Cosmic Entities</strong></p>
<img src="images/wake up.png" alt="Wake Up" style="width:96%;">
<p>Prismo, who was briefly mentioned earlier, is one of the many god-like "Cosmic Entities" who inhabit the Multiverse and make up the pantheon of <em>Adventure Time</em>. Most of them have a specific purpose within the elaborate clockwork of existence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prismo is a Wish Master and the keeper of the Time Room, capable of granting one wish to anyone who succeeds in visiting him. He is kept alive by the dreams of an old man, and later by the dreams of Jake the Dog. [S06E01 <em>Wake Up</em>]</li>
<li>The Cosmic Owl monitors the dreams of every being in the Multiverse and chooses which ones will come true. Dreams containing the Cosmic Owl are therefore invariably prophetic, although these dreams are often metaphorical rather than literal.

<p><strong>The Concept of Death</strong></p>
<img src="images/sons of mars.png" alt="Sons of Mars" style="width:96%;">
<p><em>Adventure Time</em> has done a surprising amount of exploration around what might happen after you die. There appear to be four main possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could be reincarnated as a new being. This might only apply to Elementals and Agents of Change (more on these later). [S05E34 <em>The Vault</em>]</li>
<li>You could become a ghost, a soul without a material counterpart, and continue to roam the mortal plane. This normally happens when you have "unfinished business". [S06E17 <em>Ghost Fly</em>]</li>
<li>You could become a demon, a physical manifestation of a ghost, and live in the Nightosphere. [<em>Adventure Time #53</em>]</li>
<li>You could be transported to one of the fifty Dead Worlds based on the good and bad things you've done during your life and the way in which you died. It is not clear whether the Dead Worlds are actual dimensions or a separate kind of thing. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, <em>Adventure Time #53</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>It is implied that ending up in a higher Dead World is a more desirable outcome. The highest ever mentioned in the show is the Fiftieth, which appears to be the equivalent of Heaven and is probably synonymous with "Glob World". [S03E24 <em>Ghost Princess</em>, S05E21 <em>The Suitor</em>, S03E18 <em>The New Frontier</em>]</p>

<p><strong>The Concept of Magic</strong></p>
<img src="images/thanks for the crabapples.png" alt="Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!" style="width:96%;">
<blockquote>
  <p>What is the Origin of Wizardry? Pour yourself a cold glass of lemonade, sit in a comfy chair, kick your shoes off, lean back, close your eyes, and think. If reality is Mental in nature, analogous to a Cosmic Mind, and if Wizardry is a function of the Imagination, then the Forces of Nature in the Multiverse are akin to the Currents of the Cosmic Imagination. Thus, the Origin of Wizardry is at the Core of Creation, and Wizards can create or destroy as they wish, tapping into the Power of the Cosmic Imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Chapter One of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Since the Multiverse is maintained by the perceptions of the sentient beings within it, the imagination can actually be used to change the very structure of existence. This practice is most commonly known as "magic" and used almost exclusively by witches and wizards, although others can also learn to manipulate the material world using their mind.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>However insecure a wizard might be, wizardry is the realm of the Imagination, and even the flabbiest, most flop-sweaty wizard can warp your perceptions enough to make you believe they are fully capable of kicking your butt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Chapter Two of the Wizards' Enchiridion [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Magic most commonly manifests itself in the form of spell-casting, in which magic users recite incantations and channel their imagination through magically charged items in order to produce various effects. They usually have to practice one trick over and over until they are able to consistently perform it, which is why most magic users have a unique but limited arsenal of spells. There are other methods of performing magic as well. For example, Finn has performed magic via meditation and song, and Son of Rap Bear can produce explosions by rapping. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S03E07 <em>Still</em>, S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>, S10E03 <em>Son of Rap Bear</em>]</p>
<p>According to Betty Grof's MMS theory, all magic users have varying levels of magic, madness, and sadness. These three properties are required in order to reliably perform magic. [S06E38 <em>You Forgot Your Floaties</em>]</p>
<p>There are two perspectives on the concept of magic. Scientists like Princess Bubblegum believe that it happens due to observational quantum effects and is grounded in scientific principles. On the other hand, magicians choose not to question the methods by which magic is possible, and, thanks to this blind belief, they are far more proficient at performing it. Neither view is incorrect.

<img src="images/the enchiridion.png" alt="The Enchiridion!" style="width:96%;">
<p>The Enchiridion is an ancient tome and one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the Multiverse. Its exact origin is unknown, but the author is implied to be the reader. Over the course of all of history, it is written and enchanted by thousands of wizards. These spells cause it to gain sentience, change with every reading, and contain knowledge from the past and future. The original tome is over eight million pages long. Various abridged copies are eventually produced, all of which retain its magical properties. The tome is split into two books: one for heroes and one for wizards. It teaches heroes how to conduct themselves and best serve their wizard masters, and it teaches wizards how to perform many ancient and secret forms of magic. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Every ten thousand years, the Enchiridion transports its original author to the Time Room, where they must make a choice. They can either force the Multiverse to reset to how it was ten thousand years ago, or they can allow it to continue into the unknown. The author almost always chooses to have it reset.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since we've done this thousands of times, you may feel this Universe has been played out, so to speak. Every other time, you've decided to go back in time and start over, to that moment in the quarry when you were carving your name and your true love's name into the side of the boulder, when you first conceived of writing The Enchiridion. You were the young Wizard who wrote it, but you've forgotten. When I become sentient enough to tell you, after ten thousand years, I remind you and ask you if you'd like to end it all and let the Unknown occur, or if you'd like to go back again and experience another variation of the last ten thousand years. The Multiverse is unstoppable. Even if it ends, it will sprout back into existence again, but this time in some new, unknown way. Just as it did when all of This began. I'm just asking. It's your decision.</p>

<p>It is somewhat unclear how this cycle fits into the rest of the history of the Multiverse.</p>
<p>Placing gems into various slots in the Enchiridion can produce powerful magic spells. Most notably, filling the gem slots in the front cover enables the user to open a portal to any dimension in the Multiverse, and might even allow for time travel.

<p>A demon named Hunson Abadeer comes into being around this time:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My single earliest memory occurred eons before the Mushroom War. This memory consists of one image: me eating a ham sandwich, perched atop Rock Candy Mountain, overlooking the Sea of Something, long before Plants, Animals, and Actual Things came into existence in the Land of Ooo, surrounded by an all-encompassing Night of Nothingness.

<p>Aside from Earth, a multitude of other planets in and around the Solar System are also inhabitable.

<li>The asteroids inhabited by the leaflans and the tuffbones, which appear to be fairly near to Earth because Bubblegum can see them through a telescope and reach them using a conventional rocket. [<em>Marceline Gone Adrift</em>]</li>
<li>The home planet of Cuber and his sister Tuber, where the graybles would be invented. It appears to be a fairly Earth-like world. [S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>]</li>
<li>The planets which were once terrorised by Orgalorg (pictured above). They are home to a range of unique lifeforms. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</li>
<li>The planet of the koala people. From what we have seen, this appears to be a desert world where food and water is scarce but gold is plentiful. The koala people fall under the oppressive regime of a group of humanoid lizard people, leading to the emergence of a group of rebels who have been fighting for their freedom ever since. Many other alien species are present on this planet, which reinforces the theory that there is some kind of interstellar community. [S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</li>
<li>The home planet of the grey aliens. According to Tree Trunks' alien husband, a round trip from Earth to this planet and then back would take at least forty years. It is abandoned by its native inhabitants at some point. [S08E17 <em>High Strangeness</em>]</li>
<li>Nerraw, the home planet of Warren Ampersand, a small world orbited by an even smaller black hole. Its entire society and culture is fabricated by Warren. [S10E10 <em>Jake the Starchild</em>]</li>

<p><em>Note: The spelling of "Nerraw" has not been confirmed.</em></p>

She betrays them and has them locked outside the Earth Dimension so that they can do no further harm. [<em>Adventure Time #59</em>]</p>
<p>To prevent the evil Elementals from ever returning, Lun sacrifices herself to create the Sword of Lun, a weapon capable of destroying them. Before being used, the sword must await its true bearer, "a warrior who can withstand great bodily loss without injury". [<em>Adventure Time #61</em>]</p>

<p><strong>The Earthly Elementals</strong></p>
<img src="images/evergreen 2.png" alt="Evergreen" style="width:96%;">
<blockquote>
  <p>Ever since life began on this planet, there have always been embodiments of the four elements: Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime. Across eons and millennia the four Elementals lived, and died, and lived again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Patience St Pim [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>The Elementals are powerful wizards who live on Earth and each represent one of the aforementioned elements. They possess the power to generate and shape their own element in a variety of ways. Whenever an Elemental dies, their soul is reincarnated into a new body, meaning that there is almost always a living representative for each element at any one time. The Elementals can occasionally make contact with their past lives. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, S08E19 <em>Jelly Beans Have Power</em>]</p>
<p>The fifth element, Lumps, behaves as an "anti-element", and also has an associated Elemental to go with it. The Lumps Elemental is capable of undoing the magic of the other four, as well as some other types of transfiguration magic. Furthermore, Lumps apparently permeates through the universe, similar to aether, its classical counterpart. A Lumpy Space person is seen on the planet of the koala people, suggesting that Lumpy Space is accessible from anywhere in the universe. [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>, S06E41 <em>On The Lam</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lumps are the subspace molecular lattice that binds together the scientific and magical forces of Ooo. More powerful than any one element, it's the force that orders reality into its true shape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Lumpy Space Queen [S09E09 <em>Skyhooks II</em>]</p>
<p>Like all magic users, the power of the Elementals is entirely dependent on the elasticity of the Earth Dimension. For example, Evergreen, who lived millions of years in the past, is capable of constructing an entire castle from ice, whereas the fire elemental of the pre-war era struggles to heat a single cup of coffee.

</blockquote>
<p>- Grob Gob Glob Grod [S06E25 <em>Astral Plane</em>]</p>
<p>Every comet strike brings great change to the world by delivering a being known as an "Agent of Change" or "Comet Avatar". Sometimes, the Agent of Change will succeed in turning the world into a better place. But sometimes, the comet delivers great evil into the world, and an era of destruction and death ensues. Like the Elementals, the Agents of Change are reincarnated after death so that they can continue their mission over the course of more than one lifetime. [S06E43 <em>The Comet</em>]</p>
<p>The Comet takes on a different colour every time it strikes. So far, four have been depicted: Green, Yellow, Blue, and Purple.

<p>During the time of the dinosaurs, the four Elementals are Urgence Evergreen (Ice), Balthus (Fire), Chatsberry (Candy) and Slimy D (Slime). The Lumps Elemental of this time is never mentioned. Evergreen the Ice Elemental has a mutated dinosaur servant named Gunther, who vainly hopes to eventually become his master's magical apprentice. Gunther briefly meets Finn and Jake while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point. [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>, <em>Beginning of the End #4</em>]</p>
<p>Evergreen spots the impending Green Catalyst Comet and notices that it is far more powerful than those that have come before it. It carries so much power that it would wipe out most of the life on the planet, so Evergreen seeks a way to stop it. He uses his knowledge of technology and magic to construct a golden crown capable of granting its wearer their greatest wish, but it needs a power source: the ruby eyes of the lava dog Magwood. To help battle Magwood and retrieve the eyes, Evergreen summons the other three Elementals to his castle from their respective realms. They reject his plan, stating that wish magic is too dangerous and reminding him that even if they die, they will be reincarnated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hath not a Comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness? If this Comet hits, we four indeed may perish, but the elements we embody - Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime - will live on. But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Balthus [S06E24 <em>Evergreen</em>]</p>
<p>Ignoring their advice, Evergreen has them frozen and sets off to take on Magwood alone. His mission is successful and he retrieves the eyes before rushing them back to his castle and completing the crown. However, just as he is about to use it to vanquish the Comet, he is attacked by Magwood, who begins to knock down sections of the castle in its blind rage. Evergreen becomes trapped under debris and is unable to put on the crown and wish for the Comet's destruction, so he instead orders his dinosaur servant Gunther to do it. But Gunther's greatest desire is not to destroy the Comet.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of stopping the Comet, Gunther's truest, deepest wish came true. His nose lengthened, white hair grew from his head, and a beard descended from his face as the crown changed Gunther into Evergreen. Snow began swirling within the room. Evergreen was horrified. The Comet had arrived. It was all too late.</p>

For an unknown reason, the two species fall into multiple disputes over the course of many millennia, eventually leading to the outbreak of war. Not much is known about how the wars play out, nor who wins, although it seems to involve one or both sides engaging in aerial flying saucer combat. [S02E12 <em>Her Parents</em>]</p>

<p>One of the monsters from before the beginning of existence is Orgalorg, an evil Cosmic Entity:
<blockquote>
  <p>Orgalorg is an ancient Cosmic Entity who ruled the Solar System with his cruel and deadly whims: The Breaker of Worlds. He was seeking ever more power. He desired to intercept a Catalyst Comet and absorb its essence. Thereby did he offend the King of Mars, who decreed that Orgalorg should be cast down. And yes, he was cast down, by the flaming sword of Grob Gob Glob Grod. Orgalorg was banished to an inhospitable planet where he would forget everything. Yea, even forget his identity and from whence he came. And the prophets say that the gravity of the planet did crush and compress Orgalorg into a more powerless and cuddlesome form.</p>

<p>The powerless and cuddlesome form of Orgalorg is an immortal penguin who will much later become known as Gunter. He becomes a hunter-gatherer alongside early humans. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<p><em>Note: Orgalorg/Gunter's gender is ambiguous. However, all characters in the show assign him male pronouns so I will too.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Yellow Catalyst Comet strikes the Earth and leaves behind its Agent of Change. Given the colour scheme, it's possible that this Agent of Change will eventually be reincarnated as Jake the Dog, although this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: This probably takes place after the first coming of GOLB because GGGG is wearing their "groovy headgear" to hide their baldness during their fight with Orgalorg.</em></p>

<p>The penguin form of Orgalorg appears in some hieroglyphic artwork from the time of the Ancient Egyptians, implying that he joined their society. Construction of the Egyptian pyramids is completed in approximately 2560 BCE, and Charlie, one of the children of Jake the Dog, would study tarot reading and divination there thousands of years later. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>, S08E11 <em>Daddy-Daughter Card Wars</em>]</p>
<p>As humans continue to develop and thrive, the elasticity of the Earth Dimension settles into a more rigid pattern, bringing about the end of magic. For now. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>During the height of the Roman Empire, the penguin form of Orgalorg is a gladiator and a chariot racer in Ancient Rome, and is depicted in some pottery from the time. During the middle ages, he joins some kind of hooded organisation: possibly a monastery or a secret society. During the Elizabethan era, he lives in Britain and appears alongside Elizabethan nobles.

When one of the Heroes' swords was unexpectedly stolen by a flying serpent who liked shiny things, the other Hero split his own sword in half, and the two gladiators each fell on one half in defiance of the cruel emperor's order. Throughout the centuries, the Dual Swords have been separated many times by merchants, curio collectors, and thieves, but they always seem to find their way back together.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, Saint Nicholas comes into possession of Evergreen's crown and wears it. Like the dinosaur Gunther, the original Santa's consciousness becomes stored in the circuitry of the crown. He briefly gains the powers of the Ice Elemental, which could be the cause of Santa Claus' later association with snow and ice. It is unknown whether he is able to overcome the crown or if he succumbs to it until it finds its next host.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>- Gunther's consciousness [S08E01 <em>Broke His Crown</em>]</p>
<p>Likewise, the consciousness of an Icelandic boy named Sveinn becomes stored in the crown's circuitry after wearing it just once. Given his heritage, it's possible he has some relation to the Scandinavian dockworker who would later sell the crown to Simon Petrikov. [S08E01 <em>Broke His Crown</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That's Sveinn. He only wore the crown once.</p>

<p>The fact that he wore it so briefly suggests either that he is able to overcome its influence or that he dies not long after wearing it.</p>

<p>Sometime around the dawn of the twentieth century, the penguin form of Orgalorg opens a drinks manufacturing company called "Gunto's" and becomes fairly wealthy thanks to its success. He owns a car (closely resembling a Ford Model T) and probably still lives in Britain. It seems unlikely that an immortal penguin god would be able to adapt and blend in so well with modern society, but somehow Orgalorg manages to do so without raising too many eyebrows. [S06E40 <em>Orgalorg</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: Orgalorg has not yet been renamed Gunter at this point, so the similar name of the company must be a coincidence.</em></p>
<p>During the First World War, he becomes a fighter pilot for the British Royal Air Force and flies a biplane resembling a Sopwith Camel, which entered service in 1917 CE (93 BMB). It is unknown whether or not Orgalorg had any involvement in the Second World War, but at some point he becomes a movie director.

<p>After the death of an unknown previous Elemental, the spirit of the Ice Elemental is reborn as Patience St Pim. She and the other Elementals of the modern generation discover their powers and eventually find one another, although their powers are weak due to the rigidity of the Earth Dimension at this time.

<blockquote>
  <p>Purity, that's the key! The purity of the elements! I can smell the magic humming off you two, but in this era there's hardly a whisper of the stuff! I need to get myself to some other time, where the magic has more juice! More grit!</p>

<p>Despite his comfortable integration into human society, Orgalorg somehow realises that he is something more than just an immortal penguin. Since it was the gravity of the planet Earth which compressed him into his current weak form, he recognises that he must attempt to escape into space so that he can take his true form. Meanwhile, a man named Davey Johnson works a desk job at a space agency and is a previous life of Finn Mertens. He is offered the chance to go to space but declines, and thanks to this decision he spots Orgalorg trying to steal the rocket and has him apprehended. [<em>Adventure Time #50</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: Davey was alive before the war, meaning that if the Blue Comet struck at the same time as the war then Davey was actually a previous life of the Blue Comet rather than a future reincarnation of it. This suggests that the Catalyst Comet is not the "original" progenitor of the Agents of Change, so the existence of Davey should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

<p>Magic has mostly died out by modern times, with the great heroes and wizards of old becoming nothing but myths and legends. However, there still seems to be a vague awareness of the existence of magic and it is suggested that a number of people still believe in it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself - just had a fascination with superstitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p>Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof are both post-graduate antiquarians studying ancient artifacts and their relation to magic at the University of Petrograd in Russia. They meet each other just before Betty was due to leave on a six month trip to study petroglyphs in the Australian outback. She cancels the trip and becomes almost obsessed with Simon. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S10E11 <em>Temple of Mars</em>]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>- Betty Grof [S10E11 <em>Temple of Mars</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Remember how we first met, when we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first, and when you returned it you left a note inside because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.</p>

<p>Betty eventually becomes Simon's fiancÃ©e and they co-author a book called <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>. Simon's research into the arcane leads him to discover the existence of GOLB, but he is accidentally hospitalised by Betty and doesn't get any further research done on the subject.

<p>- Simon Petrikov [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>
<p>Following that, Simon discovers two major artifacts on his expeditions which challenge his previously sceptical perspective on magic. The first is Evergreen's crown, which he purchases from an old dockworker in Northern Scandinavia. The second artifact is a copy of the Enchiridion, which he discovers with help from Betty. [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On my recent expedition to Islamabad, in a secret vault in the Hindu Kush Mountains, I discovered an incredible artifact - an ancient book known as "The Enchiridion".

<p>Simon returns to Betty and shows her the crown, putting it on his head as a joke. Suddenly, his head is filled with "secrets of the ice and snow" as the crown continues to fulfil Gunther's wish from all those millions of years ago, and his transformation into a mad ice wizard begins. He chases Betty through the streets, shouting for his princess and firing icy blasts from his hands. While Betty is hiding around a corner, a portal suddenly appears beside her and a version of Simon from a thousand years in the future speaks to her through it. Simon tells her that she disappeared after he wore the crown, and, realising why, she jumps through the portal and joins him in the future. Following Betty's mysterious disappearance, the present day Simon begins to lose his sanity as he slowly succumbs to the crown. He records tapes documenting his physical and mental transformation. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The visions. I fought with them. Shouted at them until I realised it wasn't real, it was the crown... Since then, I see the visions always, whether or not I wear the crown.

</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his tapes [S03E20 <em>Holly Jolly Secrets Part II</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: In "Holly Jolly Secrets Part II", Simon states that when he took off the crown he saw Betty "staring at him with such contempt".

[S04E05 <em>Return to the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>It seems like Hunson leaves them on their own them at some point shortly before the war:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>- Hunson Abadeer, in the Encyclopaedia [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
<p>After a quick escalation, the world erupts into nuclear war. The Great Mushroom War earns its name from the mushroom clouds produced by the bombs, which reduce most of human civilisation to ashes. By far the biggest is the "Mushroom Bomb", which is powered by something else besides its nuclear payload. It massively increases Earth's elasticity, delivering magic back into the world, and is likely what leaves the distinctive crater in the Earth's surface. It's possible that the whole thing is orchestrated by the Lich, since the bomb allows him to rise from his dormancy. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: It hasn't been confirmed how the crater was formed. The most obvious answer seems to be the Mushroom Bomb, but when it is seen detonating in "Finn the Human" and "Elemental", it is nowhere near as destructive.

<p>Due to the increased elasticity, the world begins to change very rapidly.

<p>Simon, who by this point is much further into his transformation into the Ice King, travels around the ruins of the city for a while and eventually comes across the five year old Marceline, abandoned and crying in the street. He gives her a plush from a nearby toy store, which she names Hambo. [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>]</p>
<p>Marceline appears to have been left there by her mother, who leaves a note for anyone who finds her:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In his diary, Simon describes a sentient mist that corrupts and mutates any survivors who are exposed to it and "hangs low like a London fog"; possibly an early formation of the Lich. He says that the dying survivors do not trust him due to his immunity, which is probably thanks to the crown. The sky lighting up again could be a reference to the Catalyst Comet.

<p><strong>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</strong></p>
<img src="images/simon & marcy 2.png" alt="Simon and Marcy" style="width:96%;">
<p>Simon and Marceline have begun to settle into their post-apocalyptic lifestyle. Simon becomes a father figure to Marceline in a way that her real father had never been. He gives Marceline a rudimentary education despite the fact that his mental state continues to deteriorate. They both practice kung fu using books they find. Simon begins writing a journal called <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>One day, the two get pursued and cornered by oozers. Simon is forced to use the crown for self-defence, using his powerful ice magic to defeat them. However, it further transforms him and his descent into madness accelerates. At the same time, a collective consciousness called the Mother Gum forms in the ruins and begins helping them. Marceline is seven years old at this point and Simon is forty-seven. [S05E14 <em>Simon & Marcy</em>]</p>

<p><em>Continuity error: "The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook" suggests that this takes place a few days after the end of the war, but it can actually be calculated to occur two years later: Marceline told the story to Finn and Jake two years before 1000 AMB, and the flashback card stated that it happened 996 years before then, meaning that this actually happened in 1000 - 2 - 996 = 2 AMB.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after this, Marceline and Simon move into an abandoned penthouse apartment and see ghosts for the first time. It is possible that a low level Dead World briefly intersected with the material plane, and these ghosts were victims of the Great Mushroom War. It is also possible that this is when Simon begins to develop his "wizard eyes" which enable him to see into a dimension called the Spirit World.

<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his journal [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>After realising that he is not going to be able to look after Marceline for much longer, Simon seeks a way to contact her father, Hunson Abadeer. He happens to come across a demon from the Nightosphere, and realises that this is where Marceline originates from.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know I can control myself for a while longer but soon, weeks or months or years from now, when I finally lose it, I'll need someone to take care of her when I'm gone.

</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his journal [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Simon's condition becomes so bad that he is hardly able to remember and write about the day's events, so Marceline takes over writing <em>Weekly Records in the Wreckage of the World</em>, and renames it to <em>Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>. She is ten years old at this point, and Simon is fifty.</p>
<p>Even though he stops writing the journal, Simon scribbles many of his thoughts and lyrics onto any bits of paper he can find. Some of them are notes to Marceline which she wouldn't get to read for a millennium to come.</p>

  <p>Marceline. Is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Petrikov, in his notes to Marceline [S04E25 <em>I Remember You</em>]</p>
<p>Shortly after this, an enormous tidal wave hits the city for one of many possible reasons. The detonation of the Mushroom Bomb, the impact of the Catalyst Comet, or the general elasticity of the world could all be responsible. This is likely the beginning of the formation of the island continent that would eventually become known as the Land of Ooo. Simon and Marceline slowly and purposefully make their way to higher and higher ground, and for a while Marceline seems to enjoy the relative simplicity of her life. The need to keep moving and stay with Marceline seems to help Simon remain sane for a little while longer. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<p>Eventually the water stops rising, and Simon and Marceline arrive in another ruined city.</p>
<p>Ever since he first put it on, the crown has been urging Simon to re-establish Evergreen's realm of ice, so he finally decides to leave Marceline. To keep Marceline safe, he finds a way to reunite her with her father, Hunson Abadeer. He finds a copy of <em>Mystic Rituals and their Space Time Applications</em>, the book he co-authored with Betty Grof, and uses it to open a portal to the Nightosphere. He is then able to cast a "binding spell" on Hunson:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It was all there in the book, and even though I was losing my mind, I did it, Marceline! I completed the ritual! The portal actually opened! A rip between dimensions appeared. I saw Hunson and he saw me, each of us watching the other through a weird rip in the barrier that separates our two worlds. After I completed the binding spell on your dad the portal closed and everything went dark. God knows what I did. All I know is that I left you on my sled, headed north, where I will establish my kingdom, as in ancient times Gunther!</p>

<p>Simon records the last of his tapes as a message for the missing Betty, calling her his "princess". He also leaves Marceline with photos of her mother. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<p><strong>Marceline and Hunson</strong></p>

<p>After travelling on her own for a while, Marceline stalks two survivors who turn out to be thylacine werewolves named Remi and Rosella, who are proficient in the arcane arts. She befriends them and they agree to help her summon her father, Hunson Abadeer, since they believe he can help them vanquish the tribe of vampires that threatens their pack. Remi and Rosella successfully summon him,  and he bursts uninvited into Marceline's makeshift fort. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Marceline! Long time no see. Some goober with glasses summoned me. Let's go suck some souls!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Hunson Abadeer [S10E07 <em>Marcy & Hunson</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: The episode "Marcy & Hunson" is probably suggesting that Simon directly summoned Hunson. However, according to Marcy's scrapbook, Simon simply cast a binding spell on Hunson, and then it was Remi and Rosella who actually summoned him. I'm going with the second scenario simply because there is more story behind it.</em></p>
<p>To Marceline's horror, Hunson takes Remi and Rosella's souls, reducing them to lifeless husks. Despite this, she knows that this is probably her only opportunity to get to know her father:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even though I hate him for sucking the life from my friends, I need to humour him because, let's face it, who knows what he could do? I can't let him know I don't like him. I can't write him off too quickly. Besides, he's the only one with the answers. There is still so much I don't know about myself and where I come from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Marceline Abadeer, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p>Their relationship becomes somewhat stable after a day at an abandoned carnival, and Marceline believes she is beginning to understand her father's motives. She inherits the Abadeer Axe, the weapon used by Hunson to take over the Nightosphere all those years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When I touched it, a strange feeling coursed through my veins, like a jolt of energy. This axe has some serious juju about it. Good or bad, I didn't really care. It's a gift from my Dad, and I will cherish it forever. Funny how your feelings can change so completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Marceline Abadeer, in her scrapbook [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: The graphic novel "Seeing Red" suggests that Hunson turned the axe into a bass guitar when he gave it to Marceline. This contradicts the episode "It Came from the Nightosphere" when Hunson says "Did you turn it into some kind of lute?" and is therefore false.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this friendship doesn't last long. Hunson says he wants to help the remaining werewolves with their vampire problem, so they track down the rest of the pack to a truck stop on Route 90. In a repeat of his previous actions, he wipes out the entire werewolf pack and claims that he "helped" them, since the vampires would have killed them anyway. Upset with him, Marceline goes into the truck stop and manages to make fries, but Hunson eats them. This is the last straw. In a rage, Marceline banishes him back to the Nightosphere, abruptly ending his nine day visit. She writes the <em>Fry Song</em> shortly after. [<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

<p>She returns to the city where Simon left her and starts living in the abandoned mall. All of the survivors who used to inhabit it have either perished or moved away by this time. She meets a dog that managed to survive on the food in the mall's pet shop, and names it Schwabl. At some point, Marceline converts the Abadeer Axe into an electric bass guitar, although she is still able to proficiently wield it as a weapon.

[<em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>, S07E09 <em>The Empress Eyes</em>]</p>
<p>Before long, she is a proficient vampire hunter and manages to force a stake through the heart of the first member of the Vampire Court, the Fool. She realises that she is capable of using her demon soul-sucking ability to absorb his powers, and gains from him the ability to fly. [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>Later, while trying to catch food, she accidentally lassos a human girl wearing a bunny hat, who runs away from her. She stalks her and discovers an entire tribe of survivors, who wear animal hats to protect their necks from vampire bites. They are led by a man named Two Bread Tom, and the bunny girl is named Jo. They initially run away from Marceline because of her sharp demon teeth and her ability to fly, but eventually come to trust her. She becomes good friends with Jo.

<p>In the ruins of the city, Marceline meets a second tribe who appear to be an offshoot of the first.

[<em>2015 Spoooktacular</em>]</p>
<p>At some point, the third member of the Vampire Court, the Empress, meets Simon and tricks him into doing her bidding. Marceline stakes the Empress and gains from her the power of invisibility. It is unknown whether or not she meets back up with Simon during this ordeal.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you really cared about him, why'd you let him degenerate into this pathetic clown character? He used to have more of a silver fox thing going on with his hair and those cute glasses. He was happier then, you know. When he was serving me.</p>

The tribe travels to the shoreline and begins refurbishing a large pre-war cargo ship. Marceline goes with them to protect them.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>- Two Bread Tom [S07E07 <em>Everything Stays</em>]</p>
<p>The tribe is suddenly attacked by the last of the vampires and is forced to set sail as soon as possible. Marceline stakes the Heirophant, absorbing his shape-shifting powers. This leaves the Vampire King as the very last of his kind. However, just as she is forcing her stake through his heart, he bites her neck and transforms her into a vampire herself. The Vampire King is killed and Marceline proclaims the full title of "Marceline the Vampire Queen". The humans set sail without her. [S07E08 <em>Vamps About</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: The comic miniseries Marceline and the Scream Queens features a vampire character named Keila. This has since been contradicted because Marceline is the last of her kind. Some of the other comics also suggest that Marceline is actually a ruler due to her title, but this is false.</em></p>
<p>Marceline realises that she is allergic to sunlight and craves the colour red. She becomes immortal and stops ageing in her late teens. After accidentally draining the blood from Schwabl, she tracks down the group of wizards who obtained the Enchiridion and steals it from them. She uses a resurrection spell on Schwabl, turning him into an immortal undead creature just like her. Necromancy is added to her growing repertoire of supernatural abilities.

<p>The human tribe sets sail without Marceline and heads south-west. On the thirty-third day of their voyage, the ship is attacked by sea monsters, but they are able to fend off the creatures. The next day, they arrive on a large island where they meet up with another tribe of humans. The leaders of the tribes begin fabricating a new society and name their new home "Founders' Island". [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel]</p>
<p><em>Note: If the name of the island refers to just a single founder (i.e. Two Bread Tom) then the apostrophe would be placed like so: "Founder's Island". However, the name probably refers to multiple founders, and therefore the apostrophe should be placed after the word, like so: "Founders' Island". It is spelt the second way in the official cookbook, so that's what I'm going with.</em></p>
<p>A while later, once the humans have established a sizeable colony, Jo (Marceline's friend), Two Bread Tom, and an islander named Michiko embark on an expedition to explore more of the island. Jo gets abducted by a giant bird and carried to the other side of the island, and spends weeks making her way back again. Tom decides that, to avoid losing anyone else, the islanders should construct a guardian to kill anything that tries to enter or leave the Islands. When Jo returns, she disagrees with his plans to seal off the island, so she and a group of the other islanders rebel and split from the main group.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The humans on the Islands are able to survive the magical nuclear winter. Over the course of the next millennium, they rebuild their society to a level beyond pre-war technology. They reinvent cars, robotics, computers, flying machines, advanced medical technology, geoengineering and much more. At some point, a MO Co airship arrives at the Islands, so it's likely that MO Co helps design the final version of the Guardian. The animal hats originally worn by the tribe members to protect against vampire bites remain an important part of their culture and a symbol of their highly protective attitude. The tribe leaders, including Two Bread Tom, become deified in the islanders' mythology as the legendary "Founders", while Jo and the other splitters eventually become derogatorily known as "hiders" who try to escape the Islands.

<img src="images/skyhooks II.png" alt="Skyhooks II" style="width:96%;">
<p>A chunk of the western former United States becomes isolated and forms the small island continent of Ooo. This process is incredibly quick due to the rapidly advancing winter, the Great Tidal Wave, and the elasticity of the world. Much of the cityscape becomes completely submerged under the ocean. It is unknown exactly how long the formation takes. The Land of Ooo is west of the giant crater, suggesting that most of the rest of the United States was completely wiped off the face of the planet. [<a href="location.html">Notes on the location of Ooo</a>, <em>Adventure Time #4</em>]</p>
<p>The first known use of the word "Ooo" is by a human named Horn during the humans' voyage. The word is possibly derived from Marceline's name for the mutated zombies, "oozers", especially since Simon originally spelled it with three Os. Out of universe, it is most likely a made up word meant to suggest a sense of wonder. [<em>Islands</em> graphic novel, <em>The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook</em>]</p>

While Bonnibel is fascinated by the world around her, Neddy is terrified of everything he comes into contact with, and only his sister is able to comfort him. Eventually, he begins suckling on a small candy tree and producing a strange liquid, which seems to keep him contented. Bonnibel begins to set up her home around the tree. The tree would eventually become the Great Candy Tree at the centre of the Candy Kingdom. [S07E01 <em>Bonnie and Neddy</em>]</p>

<p>Initially her new creations are obedient, but they soon begin to act more independently. Gumbald cuts down the taffy trees, builds his own cabin, and establishes plans to build an entire city out of candy. Bonnibel doesn't like this idea so floods his construction site by creating Butterscotch Lake. Tired of his niece's control issues, Gumbald devises a plan to depose Bonnibel by creating a potion called "Dum Dum Juice" that will render her completely stupid and unable to meddle in his plans. He creates Mr. Cream Puff as a love interest for Bonnibel to distract her, then double-crosses Molly and Chicle by testing the Dum Dum Juice on them, transforming them into the candy people who would later become known as Manfried and Crunchy. Before Gumbald can use it on Bonnibel, she is able to shatter the flask containing the potion, which spills over Gumbald and transforms him into Punchy.</p>
<p>Seeing how happy and carefree these new creations are, she decides to create more of the dumb and docile candy people by administering Dum Dum Juice to them as soon as they are created.

</blockquote>
<p>- <em>Teen Zine</em> [<em>The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia</em>]</p>
<p>Marceline wakes up from her long hibernation, and is still alive thanks to the fact that vampires don't age. She meets Bonnibel Bubblegum, who by this point is preparing to construct her kingdom. Somehow, the Enchiridion that Marceline was carrying ends up stowed away on Mount Cragdor. It's possible that Marceline shows it to Bubblegum, who recognises its importance and has it protected. [S01E05 <em>The Enchiridion!</em>]</p>
<p>Despite their very opposite personalities, Marceline and Bubblegum become good friends thanks to their mutual longevity and even date for a while. Marceline takes Bubblegum to her first punk show where someone spills a chili dog on Bubblegum, so Marceline buys her a shirt from the merchandise counter to cover the stain. Despite hating the actual show, the shirt becomes Bubblegum's most treasured possession since it reminds her of all the good times they had together. [SDCC 2018: <em>P.B. & Marcy</em>, S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S05E29 <em>Sky Witch</em>]</p>
<p>They would also sometimes explore the candy mines together. After a lot of persuasion, Marceline manages to get Bubblegum to graffiti on the walls. [S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>, <em>Adventure Time Comics #23: "Forever (Not) Alone"</em>]</p>
<p>At around this time, Bubblegum coincidentally digs up both of the two gemstones which crashed to Earth millions of years ago. She turns them into magic amulets (not to be confused with the Time Amulet), one of which can shoot lasers and the other of which can bring robots to life. She gives the former to Marceline and keeps the other one for herself. [<em>Adventure Time #25</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity error: In the comics, Marceline is shown living in the Tree Fort at this time, which doesn't make any sense since this happens before Shoko's death. Also, it is implied that Bubblegum didn't create the candy people or claim the title of princess until after she met Marceline, which is now known to be false as shown in "Bonnibel Bubblegum".</em></p>
<p>Finn and Jake arrive during the construction of the Candy Kingdom while travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point. Marceline and Bubblegum are still on good terms at this point. Marceline gives them the Time Amulet which she has been holding ever since the last time Finn and Jake visited her. Since Marceline and Finn and Jake met each other in opposite order, the Time Amulet is actually an example of a causal loop, or a bootstrap paradox, having manifested from nothing with no true origin. The Time Amulet helps Finn and Jake to find their way home. [<em>Beginning of the End #4</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: This sequence of events suggests that Marceline should already recognise Finn and Jake when they first meet in "Evicted!" However, it's possible that she eventually forgets their faces.</em></p>
<p>Marceline and Bubblegum fall out after Bubblegum becomes too obsessed with politics and building her kingdom and isn't able to make time for her friend anymore. [S03E10 <em>What Was Missing</em>, S07E02 <em>Varmints</em>, <em>Adventure Time #25</em>, <em>Marceline Gone Adrift #4</em>]</p>

<p>It's likely that Marceline goes back into hibernation multiple times, which would explain why her mental age doesn't seem to be that much older than her apparent physical age, and why she is still upset with her father about the fry incident nearly a thousand years after it occurred. [S02E01 <em>It Came from the Nightosphere</em>]</p>
<p>She begins writing her angsty five hundred year journal at around this time, and also begins writing her annual hourly comics in 735 AMB.

She helps her complete her secret project, the Gumball Guardians, powerful robots that are charged with protecting the Candy Kingdom from evil. Bubblegum activates them using the power of her amulet. Despite the initial plan, Shoko becomes conflicted about completing the job after Bubblegum gifts her a new robotic arm. However, she goes through with it anyway and attempts to steal the amulet while Bubblegum is asleep. She is spotted and attacked by the Gumball Guardians, who send her hurtling into the radioactive river which still surrounds the kingdom.

<p>- Finn Mertens [<em>Princess and Princess</em>]</p>
<p>While Princess Bubblegum often comes across as a benevolent and carefree leader, the early Candy Kingdom is not as sweet as its name might suggest. She is largely feared by her subjects due to the fact that the story of the first candy people becomes warped and corrupted, framing Gumbald as the victim and Bonnibel as the enemy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>She's an unknowable goddess. When the first candy people rose against her, she transformed them into hideous monsters. Her own brother Neddy: she imprisoned him beneath the great tree. And the rattleball boys? She iced all those guys. She's amazing, and she's flippin' scary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Banana Guard 16 [S07E26 <em>The Thin Yellow Line</em>]</p>
<p>This reputation is not helped by several questionable authoritarian actions taken by Bubblegum in the early years of her reign. In order to enforce the law within the fledgling candy kingdom, Bubblegum first creates the Banana Guard. However, they are largely ineffective, so she invents a more serious police force, the aforementioned rattleballs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. Our righteous swords cut a swathe through the chaos, but we were too successful. Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational, and sentenced to death. I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Rattleballs [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum takes extreme action by having all of them executed, and reinstates the Banana Guard. Rattleballs is the only unit to escape. He leaves the walls of the kingdom and goes to live in hiding in the dump. [S05E46 <em>Rattleballs</em>]</p>
<p>In her controlling paranoia, Bubblegum also establishes mass surveillance networks in her kingdom to watch her citizens and track their every move, although it is not known when exactly she establishes these.

<p>Despite all this, the Candy Kingdom becomes the most stable, safe, and powerful state in Ooo. Under the protection of the Gumball Guardians it grows into a prosperous nation. Bubblegum creates an electricity grid by harnessing the energy of the liquid produced by her brother Neddy, decontaminating the radioactive river in the process. Her territory expands to encompass a large portion of the grasslands. She builds a grand castle and spends a lot of her time locked up inside studying science.

<p>Numerous other kingdoms and states begin to crop up all over Ooo. Most of them are tiny and remain under the effective jurisdiction of the Candy Kingdom, such as the Hot Dog Kingdom. However, a few are large enough to rival it. Most notable among these are the aforementioned Fire Kingdom, the Slime Kingdom, and Wizard City. The princesses and other leaders form various political organisations to keep the peace.

<p>The Slime Kingdom eventually falls under the rule of Slime Princess, who is the reincarnation of the Slime Elemental following the death of the previous one in the Great Mushroom War. [S08E08 <em>Elemental</em>]</p>
<p>Most kingdoms are ruled by a leader with the title "princess", even though prior to the war this title was used only by female heirs. This is because Bubblegum chose to adopt the title in revenge for Gumbald mockingly calling her "prinzessin". It's likely that the other kingdom founders follow suit. [S10E04 <em>Bonnibel Bubblegum</em>]</p>
<p>However, some kingdoms including Lumpy Space and the Fire Kingdom continue to use the title in the traditional sense, with the actual rulers being called kings and queens. [S01E02 <em>Trouble in Lumpy Space</em>, S03E26 <em>Incendium</em>]</p>
<p>Bubblegum probably distributes the Gems of Power from the Enchiridion to some of the other royals for safekeeping. They all attach the gems to their crowns, including Bubblegum who keeps one for herself, granting them immunity to the Lich's telepathic abilities. [S04E26 <em>The Lich</em>]</p>

<p>- Pudding Troll [S10E09 <em>Blenanas</em>]</p>
<p>Every Thursday, a comic magazine called <em>Ble</em> is printed and distributed from an office in the ruins of a pre-war city. But five hundred years before the events of the series, their office suddenly and mysteriously ceases printing, leaving the skeletons of former employees slowly gathering dust at their desks. Ice King continues to send them his own short stories (sometimes featuring Fionna and Cake), but to no avail.</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: It's possible that the employees were already dead by the time the Pudding Troll was employed to guard the building, so the magazine might actually have ceased production before or during the Mushroom War. This would explain why the skeletons appear to be human and why the offices are in pre-war ruins. This is further evidenced by the fact that "Bletters to the Bleditor", a piece in the SDCC 2018 crew zine, made reference to several real world pre-war locations, such as Las Vegas and London.</em></p>

The Nameless Kingdom was directly mentioned in Adventure Time #75, suggesting that it does indeed exist. Additionally, the final form of Nightmare Princess in SotNK looks very similar to Nightmare Princess from the episode "Orb". This appears to be the show acknowledging the existence of the Nameless Kingdom, but might also suggest that the game is non-canon since Finn does not recognise the princess when they meet in "Orb".</em></p>

<p>In his grief and madness over the loss of Margles, Magic Man has spent the past few millennia tormenting the people of Mars. Most notoriously, he creates three plagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Plague of Shadows causes people's shadows to come to life and attack them.</li>
<li>The Plague of the Oneness causes every Martian to become stuck hand in hand.</li>
<li>The Plague of Hair causes all the water to turn into hair. The Martians get so thirsty that they drink it, and it makes them go bald, hence why many of them wear "groovy headgear".</li>
</ul>
<p>His last act against the Martians is chaining them all together and driving over them with a school bus as a literal enactment of "throwing them under the bus". After escaping from the chains, Abraham Lincoln gives up trying to reason with Magic Man and finally sentences him to banishment. [S04E15 <em>Sons of Mars</em>, S08E07 <em>Normal Man</em>]</p>

<p>Martin Mertens is a human conman living on Hub Island. He tricks hiders into gathering on the beach for fake escape plans and then reports them to the seekers for capture, reaping reward from both sides. One day, a hider named Widow sees through his con and makes him accompany her to the beach. Widow and the other hiders are captured and sent to re-education. The seekers also mistake Martin for a hider, and Kara Strong breaks his legs, hospitalising him. A "helper" named Doctor Minerva Campbell is charged with treating Martin's injuries.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You're alright, doc. Hey, y'know I'm not going to re-ed tomorrow, right? I'll tell them this was just a misunderstanding and then I'll glide out the front door a free man. Free to have dinner... with you?</p>

<p>After escaping re-education, Widow and a group of hiders break into Martin's home in an attempt to enact revenge.

In the resulting battle, Martin manages to blind the Guardian before being thrown out into the ocean. He and Finn become separated and both inadvertently leave the island.</p>

<p>Martin is pulled from the ocean by the same crew that was once captained by Tree Trunks. He has a severe head injury, which is probably the cause of his memory loss and insanity later in life.

However, Tree Trunks was already living in the Candy Kingdom with Wyatt at the time of Jake's birth as shown in "Joshua & Margaret Investigations". For Tree Trunks to have been captain of La Femme du la Mer at the time of Martin's escape, either she would have had to build and sell off her company in a matter of months, or Finn is significantly older than Jake, neither of which seem plausible. Therefore, Mr. Fine-Dooty must have survived Tree Trunks' attempt to murder him, and Tree Trunks probably never knew Martin.</em></p>

<p>Since BMO had an uptime of 4748 days (exactly thirteen years) in 998 AMB, he must have undergone a reboot in about 985 AMB. [<em>Adventure Time #13</em>]</p>
<p>This reboot might be the reason that BMO does not remember the details of his own creation, since the mind of a MO is wiped during the re-installation of system drivers. However, this could just be a result of his highly inaccurate memory recollection. [S05E28 <em>Be More</em>, S09E11 <em>Ketchup</em>]
<p>It is unknown when exactly BMO enters the lives of Finn and Jake. He could have belonged to Marceline in the Tree Fort before they moved in, or Finn and Jake could have adopted him on a whim like they tried to do with the jiggler, or he could have belonged to Joshua and Margaret.

<p>Gata wanders the land and ends up climbing in through Joshua and Margaret's window. They decide to raise her as a sister to Jake and Jermaine. Later on, after Finn has also joined the family, Joshua closes the portal in his adopted daughter's mouth by using a magical item which turns her into a stone statue and erases her from the memories of everyone who knew about her.

He causes several "time slips" between the 980s and 1001 AMB, making the house seem haunted.

<p>At some point, the family moves out of the investigation bureau in the city and into a large house atop a hill in the countryside. [<em>Adventure Time #48</em>, S10E08 <em>The First Investigation</em>]</p>
<p>While the boys seem to have a fairly close relationship with their parents, things are not as simple as they might seem. Margaret is overprotective of her children and limits their freedoms. On the other hand, Joshua is eager for his children to become adventurers like him and designs deadly dungeons for them to take part in. He even teaches Jake how to pickpocket. This combination probably makes for an unhealthy family dynamic and could be responsible for Jake's later criminality.

<p>- Jake [S09E04 <em>Winter Light</em>]</p>
<p>In addition, Jermaine appears to take a back seat behind his two brothers. He isn't a powerful shape-shifter or an exotic human, so his parents seem to show less interest in him than in their other two boys. He is once accidentally knocked out by Jake while they are play-fighting. Jermaine probably craves attention from his parents, which might explain why he's the one who would later stay and look after the house following their death. [S02E08 <em>Crystals Have Power</em>, S06E33 <em>Jermaine</em>]</p>
<p>Both parents also keep secrets from their children. They never tell Jake the true origin of his powers or that Margaret is not his biological mother. Jake grows up believing that he gained his powers from rolling in a magic mud puddle and Finn grows up believing he was born from a cabbage. [S06E16 <em>Joshua & Margaret Investigations</em>, S01E14 <em>The Witch's Garden</em>, S01E22 <em>Henchman</em>]</p>

<p><strong>996 AMB, Finn is 12:</strong> Season 1 and season 2 up until <em>Mystery Train</em>.</p>
<p><strong>997 AMB, Finn is 13:</strong> The rest of season 2 and all of season 3.</p>
<p><strong>998 AMB, Finn is 14:</strong> Season 4 and about half of season 5.</p>

<p>This is the timeline presented by the main comic series. Most of the events of the comics may or may not also be a part of the main timeline.</p>
<p><strong>997 AMB (3008 CE)</strong></p>
<p>Instead of stealing the Enchiridion and accessing the Time Room, the Lich attempts to use the Bag of Holding to end the world. He succeeds in sucking a lot of people into the bag, including Finn, Jake, Ice King, Lumpy Space Princess, Marceline, and the entire Candy Kingdom including Princess Bubblegum. Several of the candy people get amalgamated into "Desert Princess", who is capable of controlling sand with her mind. Finn and Jake manage to burrow out the bottom of the bag and by working together with everyone else they eventually defeat the Lich and defeat him once and for all by throwing him into the Sun. The giant crater is filled in with sand from inside the Bag of Holding. Due to these divergent changes from the main storyline, some (but not all) events of the main comic series must occupy a separate timeline to the show.

<p>This is an offshoot of the comic timeline, created following the invention of Princess Bubblegum's time machine.</p>
<p><strong>996 AMB (3006 CE)</strong></p>
<p>Finn and Jake, after overshooting the present day while travelling through time, end up arriving two years early (during the events of the original pilot episode and then the events of <em>Adventure Time #1</em>). After realising the mistake, they travel forwards to the present day. [<em>Adventure Time #9</em>]</p>
<p><strong>997 AMB (3008 CE)</strong></p>
<p>Princess Bubblegum creates a time machine capable of transporting its user back to the moment at which it was first created, where the user will replace their past self. She destroys it after Jake misuses its power, so Jake gets Neptr to repair it. The repaired time machine transports a duplicate of Finn and Jake's minds fifteen years into the future, where they replace the minds of their future selves. Shortly after this, BMO accidentally creates two evil robots that begin to replicate themselves. [<em>Adventure Time #6</em> to <em>#7</em>]</p>
<p><em>Continuity note: This event takes place in 997 AMB when Finn was thirteen because Finn states that he is twenty eight after they travel forwards fifteen years.</em></p>
<p><strong>1012 AMB (3023 CE)</strong></p>
<p>By this point, the robots are at war with the other inhabitants of Ooo. Finn, Jake and Bubblegum create a new time machine by vowing to spend the rest of their lives building a time machine and then sending it back to the point at which they made the vow. Finn and Jake travel back to the present, where they destroy the first robots and erase the timeline. [<em>Adventure Time #7</em> to <em>#8</em>]</p>

<p><strong>0 AMB (2010 CE)</strong></p>
<p>There is still a nuclear war. However, rather than meeting after the war, Marceline and Simon become friends beforehand, and Marceline is able to assist Simon in his battle with Evergreen's crown. He remains sane enough that he succeeds in completely stopping the Mushroom Bomb using his ice powers. Unfortunately he is crushed to death under the weight of the frozen bomb, and Evergreen's crown grieves its fallen master by plunging the world into an apocalyptic ice age. The Blue Catalyst Comet misses the Earth and never delivers its Agent of Change. Marceline never becomes a vampire and therefore ages into an old woman, but is kept alive for the next thousand years by her demon physiology. She guards the crown and Simon's body.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish unworthy planet from annihilation. Frightful bombs poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror. But using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight; only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day. Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished. Then the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire Earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years.</p>

<p><strong>984 AMB (2994 CE)</strong></p>
<p>By this point, humanity has redeveloped into a medieval society and Finn Mertens, just an ordinary human rather than an Agent of Change, is born in Junk Town. He lives with his two biological parents and his younger sibling. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>]</p>
<p><strong>998 AMB (3008 CE)</strong></p>
<p>A band of outlaws who call themselves Destiny Gang rule over Junk Town. Finn's father ends up owing them money, so his mother sends Finn into the town to sell their mule. Finn discovers Marceline and steals Evergreen's crown, believing he can sell it on and save the mule. However, Big Destiny, leader of Destiny Gang, refuses to allow the debt to be paid off and instead burns down Junk Town and the Mertens home. Finn uses the power of the crown to attack Destiny Gang to save his family. His actions accidentally lead to the thawing of the Mushroom Bomb. It detonates, killing Marceline and many other humans, and releasing the Lich despite the original wish. [S05E01 <em>Finn the Human</em>, S05E02 <em>Jake the Dog</em>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the main timeline, Jake changes the Lich's wish and the Farmworld timeline is erased. However, it persists as its own independent dimension where the Lich still exists. [S05E02 <em>Jake the Dog</em>, S07E23 <em>Crossover</em>]</p>

<p>This is an offshoot of the comic timeline, created when Mnemonoid steals Finn's memories at several points through his life.</p>
<p><strong>999 AMB (3009 CE):</strong> A creature named the Mnemonoid feeds on stories, which are its main source of food. It attacks the Tree Fort and begins stealing Finn's memories since they are an excellent source of stories. Finn continues to live normally, but at periodic points he suddenly forgets several years of his life. [<em>Adventure Time #31</em>]</p>
<p><strong>1004 AMB (3014 CE):</strong> Finn forgets the previous five years of his life, and is suddenly five years older with no memory of the intervening time. By this point, Bubblegum and Marceline are the co-ruling queens of the so-called "Candy Vampire Kingdom". Small fights frequently break out between the Fire, Sand, Water, and Air kingdoms. The Mnemonoid shows up again and begins stealing more of Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #32</em>]</p>
<p><strong>1024 AMB (3034 CE):</strong> Finn forgets the previous twenty years of his life. By this point, he is married to Phoebe the Flame Queen. The Sand Kingdom has annexed the Water and Air kingdoms and declared full-fledged war against the Fire Kingdom. The Mnemonoid attacks once again and kills Marceline by exposing her to direct sunlight, then begins stealing even more of Finn's memories. [<em>Adventure Time #33</em>]</p>
<p><strong>1059 AMB (3069 CE):</strong> Finn forgets the previous thirty-five years of his life. He travels completely alone, suggesting that most of his other companions have passed away by now. The world is frozen over, which could be the result of the crown grieving the loss of Ice King like it did in the Farmworld timeline. Bubblegum, depressed and alone, lives in the frozen war-torn ruins of the Candy Kingdom. Luckily, Finn is able to remember the plans for the time machine from the robot apocalypse timeline. He travels back to the present day and is able to erase the timeline by making Mnemonoid be friends with LSP, an infinite source of gossip which is able to sustain him much more effectively than Finn's memories.

He uses a bowl of youthful essence obtained from a nation of ghosts to stay alive on the Moon for thousands of years. [<em>Adventure Time #60</em>]</p>
<p><strong>1000 AMB (3010 CE):</strong> Arklothac, the cosmic ruler of Candy, is released into the world and frees his compatriots, Zon the ruler of Fire and Ng'zot Aa the ruler of Slime.

  <li>He could become a teacher on the rebuilt Hub Island, helping the next generation of humans to be great adventurers like he once was.</li>
  <li>He could become captain of a spaceship, exploring uncharted reaches of the cosmos along with a crew comprising of many of his close friends.</li>

<p><em>Bravest Warriors</em> has its own set of historical events, but unless it is confirmed to be a part of the <em>Adventure Time</em> continuity I will not include them in this timeline. The main evidence that the two shows are set in the same continuity is an image that was shown for a single frame during Chris' premonition in the episode <em>Ultra Wankershim</em>, which shows planet Earth with a large chunk missing, just like the Earth in <em>Adventure Time</em>. A popular fan theory is that Chris is descended from Finn, given their blond hair and similar personalities. It's also conceivable that the rest of the humans living on NeoMars are descended from the Islanders. However, this is all just speculation.</p>

<p><em>Note: The Season 11 comic provides further details about the future, but at the current point in the story it is unclear whether or not this is a depiction of the actual future or of an alternate timeline. Therefore, information from Season 11 will be withheld until more is known.</em></p>
<p>Time brings many changes to the Land of Ooo.</p>
<p>The original Candy Kingdom has expanded into a vast metropolis, but has since been abandoned. The great tree at its centre, which once sustained Neddy, has withered and died. Most of the candy people appear to be held in stasis on board the Prize Ball Guardian, an immense robotic replacement for the Gumball Guardians. The Hot Dog Kingdom has grown into a far larger kingdom that it used to be. A character named Pawn Swan roams the land selling his wares, much like Choose Goose did a thousand years before him. [S05E51 <em>Lemonhope Part Two</em>, S06E35 <em>Graybles 1000+</em>, <a href="http://wolfhard.tumblr.com/post/118388594601/graybles-1000-second-promo-tonight-coming-at"><em>Graybles 1000+</em> promo art</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wolfhard/status/1038082635795292161">Steve Wolfhard's Twitter</a>]</p>
<p>Some other characters from the time of the series are known to survive until this time. Ironically, Sweet P (formerly the Lich) grows up to be a great hero and inherits the Night Sword from Finn. The new form of Gunter continues to rule over the north of Ooo fused with Evergreen's crown as the Ice Thing. As previously mentioned, BMO survives thanks to the fact that he's a robot. The original King of Ooo is still alive. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>, SDCC 2018: Ble crew zine "Kings of Ooos"]</p>
<p>Other characters do not get the opportunity to live forever. The Jiggler's casket and Mr. Fox's skull are seen in BMO's collection. Finn and Jermaine's gravestones are both seen, although intriguingly there doesn't appear to be one for Jake. It's possible that Jake lives much longer thanks to all the life essence he absorbed from his biological father. A monument to Finn is seen too, as well as a monument to either Jake or Jermaine. Simon is probably dead, given he was turned back into a normal human, although it's possible that Betty's wish to keep him safe extends his lifespan. [S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>
<p>The Earldom of Lemongrab also remains intact but abandoned. Lemonhope returns to it a thousand years after departing the Candy Kingdom to explore the world. Despite Finn and Jake's disappearance from the world, Lemonhope meets them while they are travelling through time after escaping the Vanishing Point, and informs them that their legacy has survived. [S05E51 <em>Lemonhope Part Two</em>, <em>Beginning of the End #4</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Finn and Jake! My peeps from a thousand years ago! Oh, yes. I have wandered ever since the liberation of the Earldom of Lemongrab. There is much wisdom to find out in the world, if one is humble. Alas, I have not visited those lands in many years. But stories of you two have spread far and wide. Legends of your deeds persist, long after you dudes have vanished.</p>

<p>All five elementals are confirmed to be present in the intro to the finale. Therefore, Princess Bubblegum or a future reincarnation of her is probably the unknown pink skinned individual seen behind bars in the Ice Thingdom. This means that the unknown individual holding the telescope could be Marceline, which is further evidenced by the symbol on the telescope which somewhat resembles her initials, "MA", and the fact that the individual rides the duck creature previously seen in Marceline's debut episode. Patience St Pim is still frozen in a ball of ice. Slime Princess and Flame Princess have died and been reincarnated into new forms, who are seen fighting each other. Lumpy Space Princess has also died and been reincarnated.

<p>The hybrid descendants of Jake and Lady Rainicorn become a dominant race known as "pups" due to how quickly they are able to breed and grow up. They build a city, possibly alongside the humans from the Islands, and reinvent advanced space travel, connecting Earth with other space-capable civilisations including the grey aliens. The pups appear to be ruled by Gibbon, the son of Charlie and one of Jake's grandchildren. Gibbon has obtained one of the jewels from the Ice Thing, which is likely what grants him his immortality and his pink ice powers. In addition, he learns the power to "extinguish" other pups' powers.

<p>Two adventurers travel the Land of Ooo. They are named Shermy and Beth, and they could be future reincarnations of Finn and Jake.

<p>Beth, whose former full title is Princess Betony Burrito Jakson IV, runs away from her kingdom to avoid having her powers extinguished by Gibbon, and remains a fugitive.

<p><em>Continuity error: The Encyclopaedia and "Graybles Schmaybles" suggest that Cuber was alive during the events of the series. This is probably false.</em></p>

Fearing for his life, he flees from his spaceship in an escape pod and crash lands on the surface of Earth near the former Candy Kingdom. While on the run he accidentally destroys the Prize Ball Guardian which was carrying all the candy people, possibly ending Princess Bubblegum's legacy for good.

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, elephant. I'm more ancient than you. Someday I will engulf the Solar System. What was and what will be is meaningless. Meanwhile, you should wonder: are you just a two-headed pile of meat on a crash course with a cosmic dump, or do you contain the sole memory of a million dead stars? How do you light a candle without a match?</p>

<p>Death once claimed that Simon would continue to exist as the Ice King until this time, but this has since been proven false. [S05E48 <em>Betty</em>, S10E13-16 <em>Come Along With Me</em>]</p>

<h2>THE END</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Time is an illusion that helps things make sense<br>
  So we are always living in the present tense<br>
  It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends<br>
  But you and I will always be back then</p>

<p>I may live on Earth, but a part of me will always belong in the Land of Ooo. It's been quite the adventure, and I'm glad to have been a small part of this wonderful story. Thank you for reading.</p>
